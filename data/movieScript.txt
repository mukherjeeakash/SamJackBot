Forget it.It's too risky.I'm through doing that shit.You always say that.The same thing every time.I'm through, never again, too dangerous.I know that's what I always say.I'm always right too.You forget about it in a day or two.The days of me forgetting are over.The days of me remembering have just begun.You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.You sound like a duck.Quack, quack, quack.Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.After tonight?Correct.I got all tonight to quack.Can I get anyone more coffee?Oh, yes!Thank you.You're welcome.I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.Takin' more of a risk.Banks are easier.Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.They're insured.Why should they give a fuck?I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.He gives the phone to a teller.The bloke on the other end says, We got this guy's little girl.If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.Did it work?Fuckin' right it worked.That's what I'm talkin' about.Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.Cleans the place out.They don't lift a fuckin' finger.Did they hurt the little girl?There probably never was a little girl.The point of the story isn't a little girl.The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.You want to rob banks?I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.-No more liquor stores?-What've we been talkin' about?Yeah, no more liquor stores.Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.You tell'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.They make it too personal.We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.I'm not gonna kill anybody.I don't want to either.But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.See how far that gets you.Forget it.We're out of it.Well, what then, day jobs?Not in this life.What then?Garon, coffee!This place.Garon means boy.This place?A coffee shop?What's wrong with that?Nobody ever robs restaurants.Why not?Bars, liquor stores, gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.They're not expectin' to get robbed.Not as expectin' anyway.I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.Correct.Same as banks, these places are insured.Manager.He don't give a fuck.They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.Waitresses.Fuckin' forget it.No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.Busboys.Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour.really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?All the customers kept comin' in.Yeah.You got the idea of takin' their wallets.Now, that was a good idea.Thank you.Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.Yes, we did.A lot of people come to restaurants.A lot of wallets.Pretty smart, huh?Pretty smart.I'm ready.Let's do it.Right now, right here.Come on.All right.Same as last time, remember?You're crowd control.I'll handle the employees.I love you, Pumpkin.I love you, Honey Bunny.Everybody be cool!This is a robbery!Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.LoS PiRaTaS 2002 by Terrok Jungle boogie Get down with the boogie Jungle boogie Get it on Jungle boogie Get down with the boogie Jungle boogie Get it on Jungle boogie Get up with the boogie Jungle boogie Get up with the get down Jungle boogie Get down and boogie Jungle boogie Shake it around Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.Okay, what you want to know?Hash is legal there, right?It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.Those are hash bars?Yeah.It breaks down like this.It's legal to buy it.It's legal to own it.And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.Oh, man!I'm goin'.That's all there is to it.I'm fuckin' goin'.I know, baby.You'd dig it the most.But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?What?It's the little differences.I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here, but it's just there, it's a little different.Example.You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.And I don't mean just like no paper cup.I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.You know what they call.a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?They got the metric system.They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.What do they call it?They call it a Royale with Cheese.Royale with Cheese.That's right.What do they call a Big Mac?Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.Le Big Mac.What do they call a Whopper?I don't know.I didn't go into Burger King.You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?What?Mayonnaise.Goddamn!I seen'em do it, man.They fuckin' drown'em in that shit.Yuck.We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.How many up there?Three or four.That's countin' our guy?Not sure.So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?It's possible.We should have fuckin' shotguns.What's her name?Mia.Mia.How did Marsellus and her meet?I don't know.However people meet people.She used to be a actress.Oh, really?She do anything I'd have seen?I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.Pilot?What's a pilot?Well, you know the shows on TV?I don't watch TV.Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television, and on this invention they show shows, right?Yeah.The way they pick TV shows is they make one show.That show's called a pilot.Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows.and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.Some get chosen and become television programs.Some don't, become nothin'.She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.You remember Antwan Rockamora?Half-black, half-Samoan.Used to call him Tony Rocky Horror.Yeah, maybe.Fat, right?I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.I mean, he got a weight problem.What's a nigger gonna do?He's Samoan.I think I know who you mean.What about him?Marsellus fucked him up good.Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.So what he'd do?Fuck her?No, no, no, no, no.Nothin' that bad.Well, then what then?He gave her a foot massage.A foot massage?That's it?Then what'd Marsellus do?Sent a couple cats over to his place.They took him out on his patio.Threw his ass over the balcony.Nigger fell four stories.He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.Nigger fell through that.Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.That's a damn shame.But still, you play with matches, you get burned.What do you mean?You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.You don't think he overreacted?Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.It was a foot massage.A foot massage is nothin'.I give my mother a foot massage.It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.Whoa, stop right there.Eatin' the bitch out.and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.It's not.It's the same ballpark.Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies.ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.Foot massages don't mean shit!Have you ever given a foot massage?Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.I'm the foot fuckin' master.You given a lot of them?Shit, yeah!Got my technique down and everything.I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.Would you give a guy a foot massage?Fuck you.You give'em a lot?Fuck you.You know, I'm kind of tired.I could use a foot massage.Yo, yo, yo, man.You best back off.I'm gettin' a little pissed here.This is the door.Yeah, it is.What time you got?No, it ain't quite time yet.Come on.Let's hang back.Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right.for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a massage don't mean nothin'.I'm sayin' it does.Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.We act like they don't, but they do.That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.There's a sensuous thing goin' on.where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.Fuckin' Marsellus knew it.And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.That's his fuckin' wife, man.This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.You know what I'm sayin'?It's an interestin' point.Come on.Let's get into character.What's her name again?Mia.Mia.Why you so interested in big man's wife?He's goin' out of town, Florida.And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.Take care of her?No, man.Just take her out.Show her a good time.Make sure she don't get lonely.You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?It is not a date.It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.It's just good company, that's all.It's not a date.It's definitely not a date.Hey, kids.How you boys doin'?Hey, keep chillin'.You know who we are?We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.You do remember your business partner, don't you?Now, let me take a wild guess here.You're Brett, right?Yeah.I thought so.You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?Yeah, I remember.Good.Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.Sorry about that.Whatcha havin'?Hamburgers.Hamburgers!The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.What kind of hamburgers?Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.No, no, no.Where'd you get 'em?McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?Where?Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.Big Kahuna Burger!That's that Hawaiian burger joint.I hear they got some tasty burgers.I ain't never had one myself.How are they?They're.They're good.You mind if I try one of yours?This is yours here, right?Yeah.This is a tasty burger!Vincent!You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?Want a bite?They're real tasty.I ain't hungry.Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian, which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.But I do love the taste of a good burger.You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?No.Tell 'em, Vincent.A Royale with Cheese.A Royale with Cheese.You know why they call it that?Uh, because of the metric system?Check out the big brain on Brett!You're a smart motherfucker.That's right.The metric system.What's in this?Sprite.Sprite.Good.You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?Go right ahead.That hit the spot.You.Flock of Seagulls.You know why we're here?Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid.It's over.I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing!You were sayin'?It's in the cupboard.N-No, the one by your kn-knees.We happy?Vincent?We happy?Yeah, we happy.Look, I'm sorry, uh, l.I didn't get your name.I got yours.Vincent.Right?B-But I never got yours.My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.No, no, no.I just want you to know how.I just want you to know how sorry we are th-that things got so fucked up.with us and Mr.Wallace.W-We got into this thing with the best intentions.Really.I never.Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?I didn't mean to do that.Please.Continue.You were saying something about best intentions.What's the matter?Oh, you were finished!Oh, well, allow me to retort.What does Marsellus Wallace look like?What?What country you from?What?What ain't no country I ever heard of.They speak English in What?W-What?English, motherfucker!Do you speak it?Yes!Then you know what I'm sayin'!Yes.Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!What?l.Say what again!Say what again!I dare ya!I double dare you, motherfucker!Say what one more goddamn time!H-H-He's black.Go on!He's bald!Does he look like a bitch?What?Does he look.like a bitch?No!Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch?I didn't.Yes, you did.Yes, you did, Brett!You tried to fuck him.No, no.But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs.Wallace.You read the Bible, Brett?Yes!Well, there's this passage I got memorized.Sort of fits this occasion.Ezekiel 25:17.The path of the righteous man.is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish.and the tyranny of evil men.Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper.and the finder of lost children.And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.and furious anger.those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers!And you will know My name is the Lord.when I lay My vengeance upon thee!I think you gonna find.when all this shit is over and done.I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.The thing is, Butch, right now.you got ability.But painful as it may be, ability.don't last.And your days are just about over.Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.If you mean it turns to vinegar.it does.If you mean it gets better with age.it don't.Besides, Butch, how many fights you think you got in you anyway?Two?Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.You came close, but you never made it.And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.You my nigger?Certainly appears so.The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.That's pride fuckin' with you.Fuck pride!Pride only hurts.It never helps.You fight through that shit.'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean, you gonna say to yourself, Marsellus Wallace was right.I got no problem with that, Mr.Wallace.In the fifth, your ass goes down.Say it.In the fifth, my ass goes down.Yo, Vincent Vega.Our man in Amsterdam.Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.Get your asses on in here.Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?You don't even want to know.Where's the big man?The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.Why don't you hang back a second or two.You see the white boy leave, go on over.How ya been?I been doin' pretty good.How 'bout yourself?All right.So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.At Marsellus's request.Have you met Mia?Not yet.What's so fuckin' funny?Not a goddamn thing.I got to piss.Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?It's the big man's wife.I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed, Laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for?Asshole.Gimme a pack of Red Apples.Filters?No.You lookin' at somethin', friend?You ain't my friend, palooka.-What was that?-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.Vincent Vega's in the house?My nigger, get your ass over here.What's up?Man, I'm really sorry.You shouldn't worry about it.Pack of Red Apples.$1.40.And some matches.Thanks.It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis.Whoa.I'll lend it to you.It's a great book on piercing.That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?Forget that gun.That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing.All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.Five in each ear, one through the nipple of my left breast, two in my right nostril, one in my left eyebrow, one in my belly, one in my lip, one in my clit, and I wear a stud in my tongue.Excuse me.I was just curious, but, um.why would you wear a stud in your tongue?Sex thing.Helps fellatio.Vincenzo.Step in my office.This is Panda from Mexico.Very good stuff.Now, that's Bava.Different, but equally good.And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany.Now, the first two are the same.But this one is a little more expensive.This is 500 a gram.But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went.There's nothing wrong with these two.This is real, real, real good shit.But this one is a fuckin' madman.Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.Am I a nigger?Are we in Inglewood?No.You're in my home.Now, white people who know the difference.between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit.any old day of the fuckin' week.That's a bold statement.This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.This is a seller's market.Coke is fuckin' dead as.dead.Heroin, it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way.All right.Gimme three grams of madman.Okay.Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand.I just hope that I still have some left for ya, but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.That is what a nice guy I am.I'm outta balloons.Is a baggie all right?Yeah, that's cool.All right.I'll just get one for ya.Honey, will you get me some baggies and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?Okay.Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?She ain't got a boyfriend.You wanna hang out and get high?Which one's Trudi?-The one with all the shit in her face?-No, that's Jody.That's my wife.I'm sorry, man.Thank you.No, I can't.I gotta be someplace.All right, no problemo.I'll take a rain check.Oh.Thank you, Jody.Still got your Malibu?Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day?What?Fuckin' keyed it.Oh, man, that's fucked up.Tell me about it.I had it in storage for three years.It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.They should be fuckin' killed, man.No trial, no jury, straight to execution.I wish I could've caught him doin' it.I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.What a fucker!What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile?Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.You don't do it.It's just against the rules.Thank you.Thank you.Mind if I shoot up here?Hey, mi casa es su casa.Muchas gracias.Hi, Vincent.I'm getting dressed.The door's open.Come inside and make yourself a drink.Mia.Hello?Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when his daddy would visit he'd come along Vincent.Vincent.I'm on the

the.Durward Kirby burger, bloody.And.a five-dollar shake.How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?Martin and Lewis.Did you just order a five-dollar shake?Mm-hmm.That's a shake?That's milk and ice cream?Last I heard.That's five dollars?You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?No.Just checking.I'll be right back with your drinks.To Lonesome Town To cry my troubles away Could you, um.roll me one of those, cowboy?You can have this one, cowgirl.Thanks.The streets are filled with regret Think nothin' of it.Lay me down in Lonesome Town I can learn to forget So.Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.Sure did.How long were you there?Just over three years.I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.No kiddin'?I didn't know that.Why would you?I heard you did a pilot.That was my 15 minutes.What was it?It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.What?Fox Force Five.Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.She was the leader.The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.The black girl was a demolition expert.French fox's speciality was sex.What was your speciality?Knives.The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.And she knew a zillion old jokes.Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick.where every show I would've told another joke.You know any of them old jokes?Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.Tell me.It's corny.Don't be that way.Tell me.No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.You'd be embarr.You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?I promise I won't laugh.That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.That's not what I meant.You know it.Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.What a gyp.Martin and Lewis.Vanilla Coke.You think I could have a sip of that?Be my guest.I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.You can use my straw.I don't have cooties.Yeah, but maybe I do.Cooties I can handle.All right.Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake!-Told ya.-I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.Don't you hate that?Hate what?Uncomfortable silences.Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?I don't know.That's a good question.That's when you know you found somebody really special.When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad.We just met each other.I'll tell you what.I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.You sit here.and think of something to say.I'll do that.Okay.I said goddamn!Goddamn!Goddamn.I need some hair spray.Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?We're lucky we got anything at all.I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.Which one?There's two Monroes.No, there's not.That is Marilyn Monroe.That is Mamie Van Doren.I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.Pretty smart.Yeah.I got my moments.So did you think of somethin' to say?Actually, I did.However.you seem like a really nice person, and l.I don't want to offend you.This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.Well, well, I do.I do.But you have to promise not to be offended.No, no.You can't promise somethin' like that.I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended.Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.Let's just forget it.That's an impossibility.Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.Is that a fact?And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission?All right, all right.Well, here goes.What did you think about what happened to Antwan?Who's Antwan?Tony Rocky Horror.You know him.He fell out of a window.Hmm.Hmm.Well, that is one way to say it.Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.Is that a fact?No.No, it's not a fact.It's just what I heard.That's just what I heard.Who told you?They.They talk a lot, don't they?They certainly do.They certainly do.Don't be shy, Vincent.What else did they say?I'm.I'm not shy.Um.Did it involve the F word?No, no, no, no, no.They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.And?And.And nothin'.That's it.You heard Marsellus.threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage?And you believe that?Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window.for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.But did it happen?Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it.at my wedding.Really?Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window.except Marsellus and Tony.When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.Ladies

right!Hurry up.We're losing her!I'm looking as fast as I can!What's he looking for?I don't know.Some book.What are you looking for?A little black medical book.What are you looking for?My little black

the needle down in a stabbing motion.I gotta.I gotta stab her three times?No, just stab her once!But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.Once you do that, you p-press down on the p-plunger.Okay.Then what happens?Kinda curious about that myself.This ain't no fuckin' joke!Am I gonna kill her?She's supposed to come out of it like that.It's.All right, count to three.All right.Ready?One.Two.Three!If you're all right, then say something.Something.That was fuckin' trippy.Ohh.Oh, man.Mia.Mia.What's.What's your thoughts on.on.on how to handle this?What's yours?Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life, he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.If Marsellus knew about this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you.I seriously doubt that.I can keep a secret if you can.Shake on it?Mum's the word?Cool.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.Vincent.Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?Sure.Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.I can't wait.Okay.Three tomatoes are walkin'

that Paddlefoot.He funny, silly dog.He think totem pole alive!He arctic tenderfoot!That totem pole been here forever!Butch?One more thing, and we'll start for.Butch, stop watching TV for a second.Yeah?You've got a special visitor.Stand up.Stand up.Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a P.O.W.camp?Well, this here is Captain Koons.He was in the P.O.W.camp with Daddy.Hello, little man.Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.See, I was a good friend of your dad's.We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together.over five years.Hopefully.you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were.for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.If it'd been me who'd.not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.Butch.I got something for ya.This watch I got here.was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge.on the day he set sail for Paris.This was your great-grandfather's war watch, and he wore it every day he was in that war, and.when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed.until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country.to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.This time they called it World War ll.Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.Dane was a Marine, and he was killed.along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.Your granddad was facing death.He knew it.None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive, so three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki.a man he'd never met before in his life.to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.This watch.This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch, it'd be confiscated, taken away.The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something.his ass.Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.Then he died of dysentery.He give me the watch.I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.Then.after seven years, I was sent home to my family and.now.Iittle man, I give the watch to you.It's time, Butch.In the heavyweight division, in the right corner wearing the blue trunks, weighing 210 pounds, Floyd Ray Wilson!It's official.It's official.Wilson is dead!Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest, hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?My guess would be yes.I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.I think any man would've left the ring that fast.Do you feel this tragedy.is gonna affect the world of boxing?A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A.remain.Man, you know I didn't.Marsellus.No, it wasn't.I didn't do it.I didn't do it.How you doing?Great.I never thanked you for dinner.What you got?He booked.His trainer?Says he don't know nothin'.I believe him.I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.No, we don't wanna think.We wanna know.Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.Butch's search.How do you want it done?I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice.ready to pop a cap in his ass.I will take care of it.Mister.Hey, mister.What?You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.You're the fighter?Whatever gave you that idea?No, come on.You're him.I know you're him.Tell me you're him.I'm him.You killed the other boxing man.He's dead?The radio said he was dead.Sorry about that, Floyd.What does it feel like?What does what feel like?Killing a man.Beating another man to death with your bare hands.What are you, a weirdo?No.It is a subject I have much interest in.You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.So?What does it feel like to kill a man?I'll tell you what.Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there, and I'll tell you all about it.So, Esmeralda.Villa Lobos.Is that Mexican?The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.That's some handle you got there, honey.Thank you.And what is your name?Butch.Butch.What does it mean?I'm an American, honey.Our names don't mean shit.So, moving right along, Esmeralda, what is it you want to know?I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.I couldn't tell ya.Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it?I don't feel the least bit bad about it.What the fuck'd I tell ya?Huh?As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.I know.I know.Unbelievable.Hey, fuck him, Scotty.If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.If he never laced up his gloves, which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?It's over now.Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr.Floyd.Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr.Butch.How many bookies did you lay it around on?All eight?How long to collect?So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?No, I understand.A few stragglers aside.Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.That is great news, man.Yeah.Mm-hmm.No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.Okay, my brother.You're right.You're goddamn right.All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.Cool, brother.$45.60.And, uh, here's a little something for the effort.Now, if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?The truth.Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.Bonsoir, Esmeralda Villa Lobos.Buenas Noches, Butch.Whew.Keep the light off.Is that better, Sugar Pop?Oui.Hard day at the office?Pretty hard.Got in a fight.Poor baby.Can you make spoons?You know what?I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.I like the way you stink.Let me take this jacket off.I was looking at myself in the mirror.Uh-huh.I wish I had a pot.You were looking at yourself in the mirror, and you wish you had some pot?A pot.A pot belly.Pot bellies are sexy.Well, you should be happy, 'cause you have one.Shut up, fatso.I don't have a pot.I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did Lucky Star.It's not the same thing.I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.The difference is huge.Would you like it if I had a pot belly?No.Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.The rest of you is normal.normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass.but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small.to accentuate it.You think men would find that attractive?I don't give a damn what men find attractive.It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye.is seldom the same.If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.You'd punch me in the belly?Right in the belly.Ohh!I'd smother you!I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!You'd do that?Yeah.Promise?Yeah.Did you get everything?Yes, I did.Good job, Sugar Pop.Did everything go as planned?You didn't listen to the.Ow!You didn't listen to the radio?I never listen to your fights.Were you the winner?I won, all right.Are you still retiring?Sure am.So it all worked out in the finish.We're not at the finish yet, baby.We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?But they won't find us, will they?Do you still want me to go with you?I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.It's.Say it.Fabienne, I want you to be with me.Forever?Forever and ever.Do you love me?Very, very much.Butch.Yes?Will you give me oral pleasure?Will you kiss it?But you first.Okay.Okay.Butch.Mon amour.L'aventure commence.I think I cracked a rib.Giving me oral pleasure?No, retard, from the fight.Don't call me retard.My name is Fabby.My name is Fabienne!Stop it.Stop it!My name is Fabi.Shut up, fuckhead!I hate that mongoloid voice.Okay, okay.Sorry, sorry, sorry.I take it back.Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?Oh, I like that.I like being called a tulip.Tulip is much better than mongoloid.I didn't call you a mongoloid.I called you a retard.And I took it back.Butch?Yes, Lemon Pie?Where are we going to go?Well, I'm not sure yet.Wherever you want.We're gonna get a lot of money from this, but it ain't gonna be the kind of money.that we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever.I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?You betcha.And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.But I do not speak Spanish.Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.Besides, Mexican's easy.Donde esta el zapateria?What does that mean?Where is the shoe store?Donde esta.Spit, please.Donde esta el zapateria?Excellent pronunciation.You'll be my little mamacita in no time.Que hora es?Que hora es?What time is it?What time is it?Time for bed.Sweet dreams, jellybean.Butch?Never mind.Merde!You startled me.Did you have a bad dream?What is this you're watching?A motorcycle movie.I'm not sure the name.Are you watching it?In a way.It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.What was it about?How should I know?You were the one watching it.No, imbecile, what was your dream about?I don't know.I don't remember.It's really rare that I remember my dreams.Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.One more kiss, and I'll get up.Satisfied?Yep.Get up, lazy bones!Ohh!Ohh.God.What time is it?Almost nine in the morning.What time does our train arrive?Eleven.You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?What, Lemon Pie?I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes.with maple syrup, eggs over easy and five sausages.Anything to drink with that?Wow, that looks nice.To drink.A tall glass of orange juice.and a black cup of coffee.After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.Pie for breakfast?Any time of the day is a good time for pie.Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.Where's my watch?It's there.No, it's not.Have you looked?Yes, I've fuckin' looked.What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?You sure you got it?Yes.Bedside table drawer.On the little kangaroo?Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.Yeah, well, it's not here now.Well, it should be.Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now!So where the fuck is it?Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch?Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch?I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.Now think.Did you get it?I believe so.You believe so?What the fuck does that mean?You either did or didn't get it.Then I did.Are you sure?No.Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!Motherfucker!Motherfuckin'.Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are?No!It's not your fault.You left it at the apartment.If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.I had you bring a bunch of stuff.I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.If all I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.You're not a mind reader.Are you?I.I'm sorry.Don't be.Just means I can't have breakfast with you.Why does it mean that?Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, then I'll split.I saw your watch.I thought I brought it.I'm so sorry.Here's some money.Go out and get those pancakes.Have a nice breakfast.I'll take your Honda.I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie.Blueberry pie.Maybe not that fast.But pretty fast.Okay?Okay.Bye.Bye.Shit!Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget, she forgets my father's watch!I specifically reminded her.bedside table, on the kangaroo.I said the words: Don't forget my father's watch.Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you.i EI burro!Lookin' good, Butch.lf I were walkin' in

name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper.and the finder of lost children.And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.and furious anger.those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.And you will know My name is the Lord.when I lay My vengeance upon thee.I'm fucked.Oh, fuck.Oh, fuck.Is he a friend of yours?Oh, goddamn.Goddamn.Vincent, Marvin.Marvin, Vincent.Better tell him to shut up.He's gettin' on my nerves.Fuck.Marvin.Marvin!I'd knock that shit off if I was you.Die, you motherfuckers!Die!Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?Slip your mind?Did you forget that someone was in there.with a goddamn hand cannon?You see the size of that gun he fired at us?It was bigger than him.We should be fuckin' dead, man.I know.We was lucky.No, no, no, no.That shit wasn't luck.Yeah, maybe.This was divine intervention.You know what divine intervention is?I think so.That means that God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.That's right.That's exactly what it means.God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.Don't do that.Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!Chill.This shit happens.Wrong!Wrong.This shit doesn't just happen.Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car.or in a jailhouse with the cops?We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!All right, it was a miracle.Can we go now?Let's go, nigger!Come on!Shit.You ever seen that show Cops?I was watching it one time, and there was this cop on, and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right?He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened.He didn't hit nothin'.Okay?It was just him and this guy.I mean, you know, it's, it's freaky, but it happens.You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd, but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.What the fuck does that mean?It means that's it for me.From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.Jesus Christ.Goddamn it.Don't blaspheme.I said, don't do that!Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today.I'm through.Why don't you tell him at the same time why?Don't worry, I will.And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.I don't give a damn if he does.Marvin, what do you make of all this?Man, I don't even have an opinion.You gotta have an opinion.You think God came down from Heaven and stopped.What the fuck's happenin'?Aw, shit, man!Aw, man!Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.Why the fuck'd you do that?I didn't mean it.It was an accident.Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this.Chill out, man!It was an accident.We probably went over a bump or somethin'.The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.The gun went off.Look at this fuckin' mess!We're on a city street in broad daylight here!I don't believe it!Well, believe it now, motherfucker!We gotta get this car off the road.Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!This is the Valley, Vincent.Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!Shit!What you doing?I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.-Where's Toluca Lake?-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do, 'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.Jimmie, how you doin', man?It's Jules.Just listen up, man.Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.I need to use your garage for a couple hours.We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.If he does, what do we do?We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls, but I don't want it to reach that pitch.Jimmie's a friend.You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.Just tell him not to be abusive.He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.Put yourself in his position.It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.He wasn't expectin' this shit.We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?I was dryin' my hands!You're supposed to wash 'em first!You watched me wash 'em.I watched you get'em wet.I was washin' 'em.This shit's hard to get off.Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.I used the same fuckin' soap you did, and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man!Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right?You know I respect you and all.But just don't put me in this position, all right?All right.Fine.Fine.Ask me nice like that, no problem.Just go handle your friend.Go ahead.I don't care.Mmm!Goddamn, Jimmie!This some serious gourmet shit.Me and Vincent would've been satisfied.with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.Right?And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.What flavor is this?Knock it off, Julie.What?I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.I'm the one who buys it.I know how good it is.When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.But you know what's on my mind right now?It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.It's the dead nigger in my garage.Jimmie, don't even worry.Don't tell me about anything.I wanna ask you a question.When you came pulling in here, did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, Dead Nigger Storage?You know I ain't seen no.Did you notice the sign on the front of my house.that said, Dead Nigger Storage?No.I didn't.You know why you didn't see that sign?Why?'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!We're not gonna store the motherfucker.Don't you fuckin' realize.that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?No marriage counselor.No trial separation.I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.Okay?And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.Don't fuckin' Jimmie me, Jules!Okay?Don't fuckin' Jimmie me.There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife.Is there?Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.The graveyard shift at the hospital.You gotta make some phone calls?You gotta call some people?Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.That's Kool and the Gang.We don't wanna fuck your shit up.All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.You're fucking my shit up right now!You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.Do me that favor, all right?The phone is in my bedroom.I suggest you get going.Well, say she comes home.What do you think she'll do?Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.That ain't no kinda answer.I mean, you know, I don't.How much?A lot or a little?You got to appreciate what an explosive element.this Bonnie situation is.She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen.doing a bunch of gangster shit, there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs!All I want to hear from your ass is, You ain't got no problem, Jules.I'm on the motherfucker.Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly.You ain't got no problem, Jules.I'm on the motherfucker.Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.You sendin' the Wolf?Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?Shit, yeah, negro!That's all you had to say!She the hysterical type?When is she due?Give me the principals' names again.Place your bets.Jules.Mm-hmm.Cards, please.Vincent.Jimmie.Bonnie.It's thirty minutes away.I'll be there in ten.You're.Jimmie, right?This is your house?It sure is.I'm Winston Wolf.I solve problems.Good.We got one.So I heard.May I come in?Uh, yeah.Please do.You must be Jules.Which would make you.Vincent.Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking.Is that right, Jimmie?Uh, one hundred percent.Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?Uh-huh.I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.She wouldn't at that.That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage.Take me to it.Jimmie.Do me a favor, will ya?Thought I smelled some coffee back there.Would you make me a cup?Uh, yeah, sure.Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.About the car, is there anything I need to know?Does it stall?Does it smoke?Does it make a lot of noise?ls there gas in it?Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.Positive?Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.Good enough.Let's go back to the kitchen.Here you go, Mr.Wolf.Thank you, Jimmie.Okay, first thing.You two.Take the body, stick it in the trunk.This looks to be a pretty domesticated house.That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit.Yeah.Under the sink.Good.What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products.and clean the inside of the car.I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.Get it out of there.Wipe down the upholstery.It don't need to be spick-and-span.You don't need to eat off it.Just give it a good once-over.What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.We need to raid your linen closet.I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.The thicker the better, the darker the better.No whites.Can't use 'em.We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards.with quilts and blankets, so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last, but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.Jimmie, lead the way.Boys, get to work.Please would be nice.Come again?I said, a please would be nice.Get it straight, buster.I'm not here to say please.I'm here to tell you what to do.And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess, you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.I'm here to help.If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.No, Mr.Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated.Mr.Wolf, listen.I don't mean disrespect, okay?I respect you.I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?I can feel your look.It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.Green.Nothin' except for the mess inside.About 20 minutes.Nobody who'll be missed.You're a good man, Joe.Thanks a bunch.How we comin', Jimmie?Pretty good.I got it all here, but, uh, Mr.Wolf, you gotta understand something.Winston, Jimmie, Winston.Okay.You gotta understand something, uh, Winston.Uh.Uh, no, thank you.Uh, this is our best linen here, and it's, uh.it was a wedding present.from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.They're not with us anymore.I wanna help.Let me ask you a question.If you don't mind.No, no, please.Go ahead.Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, were they millionaires?No.Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt.Ginny.Ginny were here, they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.I like oak myself.That's what I have in my bedroom.How about you, Jimmie?You an oak man?Oak's nice.Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong.that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?Get the fuck out my face with that shit!The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull.on account of your dumb ass.I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red.I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.That's all.I could blow.Oh, you ready to blow?Yeah.Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker.Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T.I'm the Guns of the Navarone.In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail!We're fuckin' switchin'.I'm washin' windows, and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!Fine job, gentlemen.You may get out of this yet.I can't believe this is the same car.Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.Phase one is complete.Clean the car.which moves us right along to Phase two: Clean you two.Strip.All the way?To your bare ass.Quickly, gentlemen.We got about 15 minutes.before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit.Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?You know what you two look like?What?Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.Toss'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.Don't worry, we're taking it with us.Jim, the soap.Vincent.Okay, gentlemen.You both been to County before, I'm sure.Here it comes.Goddamn!The water's fuckin' cold!Yo!Yo!Yo!Better you than me, gentlemen.Don't be afraid of the soap.Spread it around.Get 'em there a little bit.Vincent's hair.Hey, get out of my hair!Come on.Do it, goddamn it!Do it!Towel.You're dry enough.Toss 'em their clothes.Perfect.Perfect.We couldn't have planned this better.You guys look like.What do they look like, Jimmie?Dorks.They look like a couple of dorks.Ha-ha-ha.They're your clothes, motherfucker.Come on, gentlemen.We're laughing our way right into prison.Don't make me beg.Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.The place is North Hollywood, so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.Now, I'll drive the tainted car.Jules, you ride with me.Vincent, you follow in my Acura.Now, if we come across the path of any John Q.Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.Right.What did I say?Don't do shit unless.Unless what?Unless you do it first.Spoken like a true prodigy.How about you, Lash LaRue?Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?The gun went off.I don't know why.I'm cool.I promise you.Fair enough.Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up.If get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.Outta my way, Rex.We cool?Like it never happened.All right.Boys, this is Raquel.Someday all this will be hers.Hi.So, what's with the outfits?You guys going to a volleyball game or something?I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.Maybe I could drop you two off.Where do you live?Redondo.Inglewood.It's.It's your future.I.I see a.a cab ride.Move outta the sticks, fellas.Say good night, Raquel.Good night, Raquel.I'll see you guys around.Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.Mr.Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.Yeah, really.And thank you very much, Mr.Wolf.Call me Winston.You see that, young lady?Respect.Respect for one's elders shows character.I have character.Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.Wanna share a cab?I'd go for some breakfast.Feel like havin' breakfast with me?Cool.I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.I know that now.But was he cool or what?Thank you.Totally fuckin' cool, in control.Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.Want some bacon?No, man, I don't eat pork.Are you Jewish?I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.Why not?Pigs are filthy animals.I don't eat filthy animals.Yeah, but bacon tastes good.Pork chops taste good.Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know.'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.Pigs sleep and root in shit.That's a filthy animal.I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.What about a dog?Dog eats its own feces.I don't eat dog either.Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty.But a dog's got personality.Personality goes a long way.Ah, so, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.Is that true?We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.I mean, he'd have to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.Oh, man, that's good.That's good, man.You're startin' to lighten up.You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit.I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.About what?About the miracle we witnessed.Miracle you witnessed.I witnessed a freak occurrence.What is a miracle, Vincent?Act of God.And what's an act of God?When, um, God makes the impossible possible.But this morning.I don't think qualifies.Hey, Vincent.See, that shit don't matter.You're judging this shit the wrong way.It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.You don't judge shit like this based on merit.Now, whether or not what we experienced.was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.God got involved.But why?Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why.But I can't go back to sleep.You're serious.You're really thinkin' about quittin'.For life?Most definitely.Yeah.Fuck.What you gonna do then?Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth.What you mean, walk the Earth?Like Caine in Kung Fu.Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.And how long do you intend to walk the Earth?'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.What if He don't do that?If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.So you decided to be a bum.I'll just be Jules, Vincent.No more, no less.No, Jules, you decided to be a bum, just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change, who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.They got a name for that, Jules.It's called a bum.And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.Garon!Coffee!Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.But water into wine, l.All shapes and sizes, Vincent.Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.If my answers frighten you, then you should cease asking scary questions.I'm gonna take a shit.Let me ask you something.When did you make this decision?When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?Yeah.I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee, replayin' the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.Fuck.To be continued.I love you, Pumpkin.I love you, Honey Bunny.Everybody be cool!This is a robbery!Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!You got that?You just be quiet over there!Waitresses on the floor!Get on the fuckin'.Get the fuck down!You're in a blind spot.Take your dames over to that booth, on the count of ten!Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie?Get down!Get down!Throw those bags!Fucking move!Move!Move!Get the fuck.Get down on the fucking floor!Grandpa!Down!I'm the manager here, and there's no problem.No problem at all.You gonna give me a problem?No, sir, I'm not.Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem!I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.Well, just execute him!I am not a hero.I'm just a coffee shop manager.Get the fuck down!The restaurant's ours!Just take whatever you want.You talk to the customers.Yeah.You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over.You understand me?Yes!Listen, everybody.Be calm, cooperate, and this'll all be over in a minute!Get the fuck down!Well done.All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets!You don't fucking talk.You just throw 'em in the bag!Are we clear?I said, are we fucking clear?Good!Now, wallets out!That's it.Get the fuck down.In the bag.In the fucking bag!I don't have nothin' on me, man.In the bag.What am I waiting for?ln the fucking bag.Laura.Laura.Tips.In the bag.Is that a cellular phone?Yeah.In the fucking bag.Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.Now get the fuck down on the floor.In the bag.In the bag.In the bag.What's in the case?My boss's dirty laundry.Your boss makes you do his laundry?When he wants it clean.Sounds like a shit job.Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.Open it.'Fraid I can't do that.I didn't hear you.Yes, you did.What's going on?Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.Shoot him in the face!I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.Stop causing problems!You'll get us all killed!Give'em what you got and get'em outta here!Shut the fuck up, fat man!This ain't none of your goddamn business!Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.No problem.I got it under control.Now, I'm gonna count to three.If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.We clear?One.Two.Three.Okay, Ringo.You win.It's yours.Open it.Hey, what is it?What is it?Is that what I think it is?It's beautiful.Goddamn it, what is it?You let him go!You let him go!Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!Tell that bitch to be cool.Say, Bitch, be cool!Say, Bitch, be cool!Be cool!Be cool!Tell that bitch to chill!You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!Chill that fuckin' bitch out!Chill out, Honey Bunny!Let go of him!Chill out, Honey Bunny!Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!I promise!Tell her to chill!Chill out, Honey Bunny!Now tell me her name.Yolanda.All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?Don't you hurt him!Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.And what's Fonzie like?Come on, Yolanda!What's Fonzie like?He's cool.What?Cool.Correctamundo.And that's what we're gonna be.We're gonna be cool.Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.And when I count three, I want you to let go of your gun, put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.And when you do it, you do it cool.You ready?One, two, three.Okay, now you let him go!Yolanda!I thought you were gonna be cool.Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.When I get nervous, I get scared.When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.Just know, you hurt him, you die.Well, that seems to be the situation.But I don't want that.And you don't want that.And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.So let's see what we can do.Now.here's the situation.Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken, but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period, and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning.to just hand it over to your dumb ass.Vincent!Be cool!Yolanda, it's cool, baby.Get back!It's cool!We still just talkin'.Come on.Point the gun at me.Point the gun at me.There you go.Now, Vincent, you just hang back.and don't do a goddamn thing.Tell her it's still cool.It's still cool, Honey Bunny.How we doin', baby?I.I gotta go pee.I wanna go home.Hang in there, baby.I'm proud of you.And Ringo's proud of you.It's almost over.Tell her you're proud of her.I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.I love you.I love you too, Honey Bunny.Now, I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.Which one is it?It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker.That's it.That's my bad motherfucker.Open it up.Take out the money.Count it.How much is there?About 1,500 dollars.Okay, put it in your pocket.It's yours.Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh?Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.No, Yolanda!Yolanda!He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!Vince, shut the fuck up!Shut up!Come on, Yolanda.Stay with me, baby.Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.I'm buyin' something for my money.Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?What?Your life.I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.You read the Bible, Ringo?Not regularly, no.Well, there's this passage I got memorized.Ezekiel 25:17.The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides.by the inequities of the selfish.and the tyranny of evil men.Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger.those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.And you will know I am the Lord.when I lay My vengeance upon you.I been sayin' that shit for years, and if you heard it, that meant your ass.I never gave much thought to what it meant.I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker.before I popped a cap in his ass.But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means.you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man, and Mr.9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd.protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.Or it could mean.you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd, and it's the world that's evil and selfish.Now, I'd like that.But that shit ain't the truth.The truth is, you're the weak.and I'm the tyranny of evil men.But I'm tryin', Ringo.I'm tryin' real hard.to be the shepherd.Go.I think we should be leaving now.Yeah, that's probably a good idea.Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.Ooh-ooh-ooh.Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.Ooh-ooh-ooh.Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.I was the third brother of five.Doing whatever I had to do to survive.Im not saying what I did was all right.Trying to break out of the ghetto was a day-to-day fight.Been down so long gettin up didnt cross my mind.But I knew there was a

Beaumonts gonna do anything Beaumont can.to keep from doin them ten years.includin tellin the federal government any and every motherfucking thing.about my black ass.Now, that, my friend, is a

right to say no.No.I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant.If I dont want to go to all that trouble, Id just take you in on suspicion now.Suspicion of what?Uh, could I say something?He just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute.Ill keep my eye on him so he doesnt take anything.Go ahead.Thanks a lot.Bad knees.You have a good flight?Its a shitty flight down to Cabo.I went down there one time with Susan, my wife.Fuckin turbulence was unbelievable.Hey, can I look in this envelope?Ah.Goddamn.Id say theres about, oh, uh.$ here.What would you say, Ray?Looks like about from here.Is this your money?What if I say no?You should know if you bring in anything over you have to declare it.You forget, or what?You can get a $ fine, plus two years in prison.You want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to Customs?Im not sayin another word.Jackie.I hope you dont mind if I call you Jackie.Those guys down in Customs?Theyre a bunch of pricks.Excuse me, but they are.Theres something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.You can go down and talk with those guys.who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings.or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.Its up to you.Lets take a look here at the file on Jacqueline Brown.According to this, this isnt the first time youve run afoul of the law.In while a stewardess for Delta.you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?That pilot was my husband, and I got off.You mean they offered you a deal, and you grabbed it.He did time; you did probation.I didnt hear you ask permission to smoke in my office.May I smoke?No, you may not.So you get off with a slap on the wrist.but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines.Cut to years later, youre years of age.flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin piece of shit Mexican airline there is.where you make what, $ a year?I make plus benefits.You been in the service industry years, and all you make is plus benefits?Didnt exactly set the world on fire, did you, Jackie?Jackie, you have a good lawyer?Can she afford a good one, is more like it.Otherwise youll be in Sybil Brand three weeks.before the public defender gets around to ya.Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?Yeah?No?Because he knows you.Well, he knew you.He doesnt know anybody now.Hes dead.They found him in a trunk of a car this morning.shot twice.Once in the chest, once in the head.Here you go.So I guess Im wondering.If you dont know Beaumont.how do you suppose Beaumont knows you?Look, Miss Brown, we dont give a fuck about you.You know who we want.If you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, well help you get out of this.If you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like youre doing now.we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court.With your prior, the judge will give you two years.Now, youll probably only end up serving a year and some change.but if I was a -year-old black woman.desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job I was fortunate enough to get.I dont think that Id think I had a year to throw away.So lets start again now, shall we?Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who in America were you bringing it to?Im not sayin another goddamn word.Id like your permission to look through this again so well know how much were talking about.Sure.Go ahead.While were at it, lets see what else is in there.Do you mind?Beauty case.Mm-hmm.Whats in it?Beauty products.Alarm clock.Glass

occupation.the state requests a bond of no less than .The People are fine with this?Im gonna set bond at .and set the date of August .for the prelim.Your Honour, when will that be?Thats six weeks from now.Well continue this matter then.Owens, case .The charge is possession of a concealed weapon.and striking an officer.How does your client plead?I thought itd be .Uh, my client would like to plead guilty, Your Honour.Is the arresting officer here in the courtroom?Uh-uh-uh.I didnt hear you wash your hands.Comfortable?Yeah.Door was open, so I just come on in.I can see that.Why?Got some more business for you.Oh, yeah?What did he do?She is an airline stewardess.Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow.They set her bond this afternoon at $ .Now, Im figuring you could take that $ you owe me from Beaumont.move it over to the stewardess.The bond for possessions only a thousand.Hmm.Yeah.Man, they fuckin with her.They callin that shit possession with intent..A -year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces.they calling that shit intent..The same thing happen to a movie star, they call it possession..Still sounds high.Well, um, she had on her, I believe it was grand in cash.All right, before we start talking about stewardesses.lets get Beaumont out of the way first.You know, I think somebody already did.What?You aint hear?Hear what?Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumonts brains out.Oh, shit.That shit rhymes.Blew Beaumonts brains out.Police make contact with you?Oh, hell, yeah.First motherfucking thing they did.You know, they see I pay a big money bond for my boy.they start thinking that where theres smoke theres fire logic.Rousted my ass out of bed : in the morning.Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda.She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure.This stewardess.You know her last name?Brown.Jackie Brown.What does she do for you?Who said she do anything for me?Shes my friend.My friends get in trouble, I like to help them out.Beaumont worked for you.This you and me talking, like lawyer-client thing?You cant tell nothing I say to you?Youre not my client till you get busted and I bond you out.Well, we aint got no, uh.What you call that shit?Confidentiality.Why should I tell you anything?Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are.You got stewardesses bringing you grand.And why would a stewardess be bringing me grand?Now you want me to speculate on what you do.Id say you were in the drug business, except the moneys moving in the wrong direction.Whatever youre into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.All right.You want another bond?You want to move the you got on Beaumont over to the stewardess.That means paperwork.I gotta get a death certificate, present it to the court.make out a receipt for return of bond collateral, type up another application.Hey, hey, hey, hey.another indemnity agreement.Jackie aint got time for this.Im telling you what I have to do.What you have to do, in case you forgot.is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks.I can do that.You know I got the money.I just aint got it with me.Come back when you do.Ill bond out the stewardess.Look, you got to look at this with a little compassion, all right?Jackie aint no criminal.She aint used to this kind of treatment.Gangsters dont give a fuck, but your average citizen.a couple of nights in County get to fuckin with their mind.Ordell, this isnt a bar.You dont have a tab.Listen to me, all right?You got a -year-old, gainfully employed black woman falsely accused.Falsely accused?She didnt come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?Falsely accused of intent..If she had that shit.and mind you, Im saying if.that was her own personal shit to get high with.Is white guilt supposed to make me forget Im

were drug-related, so.if you want, I could help you figure out your options.So far, they told me if I cooperate.then Ill get probation, maybe.Or if I stand mute, I can get as much as five years.Does that sound right?Id say that if they try you and convict you, you wont get more than a year and a day.Thats state time, prison.But they wont want to do that.Theyll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time.and a year or two of probation.Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?Yeah.But thats not what this is about.They were waiting for my ass.They knew about the money.They even knew the exact amount.What did they want to know?Who gave me the money and who I was givin it to.They found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.They said it was him

asked me if I knew Mr Walker.Yeah?I didnt tell them anything about him.My name come up?Mm-mm.You aint said nothin about me?Mm-mm.Ah, thats mighty noble of you.They tell you what happened to this Beaumont fellow?Yeah, they told me.Yeah.Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont.Or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.Yeah, I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.And you aint givin them no kind of answer?Mm-mm.You scared of me?You got any reason to be nervous around me?Is that what I think it is?What do you think it is?I think its a gun pressed up against my dick.Well, you thought right.Now, take your hands from around my throat.nigger.What the hells wrong with you, Jackie?Shut the fuck up.Dont you move.Oh, what is this?What the fuck

up.I just came over here to talk to you.To talk?The way I see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.One thing.and thats what you are willing to do for me.I can get you a lawyer.No, lets be realistic.Now, sooner or later theyre gonna get around to offering me a plea deal.and you know that.Thats why you came here to kill me.I aint come over to kill you.No, thats all right.Its okay.Now, I forgive you.Now, Iets say, if I tell on you.I walk.If I dont, Ill go to jail.Uh-huh.I want $ .in an escrow account in my name.if Im convicted up to a year or put on probation.Now, if I have to do more than a year.you pay another $ .I can do that.You know I got that problem.All my money is.In Mexico.Right.Well, I been thinking about that too.I got me an idea.Uh.Let me hear that.We friends again.Why dont you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else?Ill talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if its on.All right.You want your gun back?Come on in.Ill get it for you.Max, look, I am so sorry about this.You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow it, cause I was afraid you would say no.I mean, youd have to.Would you like some coffee?If youre having some.I am.Come on in.Why dont you make yourself at home.Just, you know, have a seat.Did you get a chance to use it?I felt a lot safer having it.Oh, the milk went bad while I was in jail.Blacks fine.Cool.Would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?It wouldnt be legal, but if it makes you feel better, I guess.Well, thanks.I got one now.You went out this morning and bought a gun?What?I didnt hear you.You went out this morning and bought a gun?Well, lets say I got one now, okay?Somebody loan it to you?Yeah.All right!Were on.It might be a little black.Would you like to hear some music?Sure.Cool.You know, I couldnt wait to get home last night.and wash the jail outta my hair.It looks nice.Thanks.You never got into the whole CD revolution?Oh, I got a few, but I cant afford to start all over again.I mean, Ive invested too much time and money.in my albums.Yeah, but you cant get new stuff on records.I dont get new stuff that often.I gave my heart and soul.To you, girl.Didnt I do it, baby.Its pretty.Didnt I do it, baby.Mm-hmm.Who is this?The Delfonics.Its nice.Didnt I do it, baby.Mm-hmm.Didnt I do it, baby.I called in sick today.As far as the airline knows, Im still available.Are you?I dont know.Im gonna go in.and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today.Im going to do what you suggested.offer to help and see what happens.What I meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.No, I want to talk to them first.I know more now about Ordells money.Well, if its the A.T.F.guy that wants you, thatll only interest him up to a point.I know, but its a lot of money.Its a half a million dollars all in Cabo, and more coming in.Howd you find that out?Ordell told me last night.He called?He came by.Whatd you do?We talked.Do you think he still trusts you?He had his doubts at first, but hes always trusted me.And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.Why?Because he needs my ass.Otherwise, that moneys just gonna sit over there in Cabo.You want some sugar?No, thank you.Theres gotta be other ways of getting it out.Maybe, but Im the only one hes ever used.I mean, he cant use his other people.Theyre crooks.I mean, he might try to.bring the money in himself.but he aint gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.So, either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.And I made him feel like he still can.Are you gonna offer to set him up?Yeah, if I get off.Otherwise, fuck em.Its very possible that Ordells killed somebody.Do you realize that?Well, I aint going back to jail, and I aint doing that probation thing again.Max, how do you feel about getting old?Youre not old.You look great.No, Im asking you how do you feel about getting old.Doesnt it bother you?Its not really something I think about.Really?I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago.It started falling out, so I did something about it.Howd you feel about that?I feel fine with it.Otherwise, I wouldnt have done it.I did it to feel better about myself, and, you know, I do.I look in the mirror.Looks like me.Yeah, but its different for men.You know, I cant really feel too sorry for you in this department.I bet that, except for possibly an afro.you look exactly the way you did at .Well, my ass aint the same.Bigger?Yeah.Aint nothing wrong with that.Something else worry you?Oh.I always feel like Im starting over.How many bonds you said you wrote?.Is that a lot?Thats plenty.Well, Ive flown over seven million miles.and Ive been waiting on people for years.Then after my bust, the best job I could get was with Cabo Air.which is the worst job you can get in this industry.You know I make a year.plus retirement benefits that aint worth a damn.And with this arrest hanging over my head, Max, Im scared.And if I lose this job, I gotta start all over again.and I aint got nothing to start over with.Ill be stuck with whatever I can get.And that shit is more scary than Ordell.Lets go.You dont have to.Ow!.Hey!Hey, great, youre here.Yeah.Hey, Jackie.Howre you doing?Fine.Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute?Sure.Take your time.Ill just be a minute.May I smoke?Absolutely.Dude, what up?She wants to make a deal.Oh, yeah?Did she sound scared?She almost sounds scared.Whats she want?She wants to go back to work.Oh, yeah?So whats she going to give us?She hasnt gone into specifics.Shes been waiting for you to get here.She knows its my case, right?Well, she hasnt said it, but shes not stupid.She knows its you who wants her.Lets go.Cool.Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.Now, what can we do for you?I need permission to leave the country so I can keep my job.Yeah, we can look into that.I need it tomorrow.If I dont show up for work tomorrow, Im fired.Well, you know what we want.If Im working,I can help you.Help us do what, Jackie?Help you get Ordell Robbie.So now, you do know him.You never asked if I did or not.So youre telling us now that you do know him.Of course I do.I deliver money for him.No shit?You know how he makes his money?He sells guns.You ever see him sell a gun?No.Then how do you know he sells guns?He told me.Besides, why else would an A.T.F.man be after him?Well, how can you help us?Ill do anything I can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.And in return for my help, I need permission to leave the country, and immunity.You dont want much, do you?Can you do it or not?You know, I mean.Its possible.Youre going to hear a guy beg for his life, lady.cause he betrayed Nani Vitali.Read the paper.Read it!.Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.Hes already killed two people.You know what hes known as?The Mad Dog Murderer.Hey, girl.Hola!.Hey!Hey, hey, hey!Looks like somebody got some new clothes.Yeah, we did a little shopping.You know, I couldnt have my boy running around looking like no bum.I dont know.I didnt look like a bum.Come on now, man.You know you had that Salvation Army thing going.Goddamn, girl.You getting high already?Its just : .Its that late?You smoke too much of that shit, that shits

get your message.I was gonna tell you!No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.Here.You gotta make sure aint nobody following you.Its ready to go?Yeah.Theres another bowl left.Take your thumb off the carb.Shit.You okay?Im just.getting old.I cant.smoke or laugh now without coughing.Coughings good.It opens up the capillaries.You know, when you cough, youre pulling air.in this case, smoke.into parts of the lungs that dont normally get used.And so, coughings good.It gets you higher.You definitely know a lot about that.Look here, Louis, I got to run out for a little while.So, since you like getting high so much.why dont you hang out here with Mel, watch a little TV?Way ahead of you.See, I get high later on when I come back.See, I get high at night when I get through with all my business.Is that Rutger Hauer?No, its Helmut Berger.Hmm.Why dont you walk me to the door, space girl?Okay.You know, I hope you dont mind hanging out with Louis.No problem.Try not to tear his clothes off of him, all right?Theyre new.Ha, ha, ha!Ha, ha!.Yo, Louis!Catch you later, man.Okay.Later.Want a Metrix?Uh.Damn.Shit.Whats a Metrix?Its like this major meal that you drink in a shake instead of having a big meal.Its like a diet thing?No.Its what bodybuilders drink to, you know, beef up.No, thanks.Okay.When was the last time I saw you?Oh.six, seven years ago.It doesnt seem like that long ago.It was that long ago.How old were you in this picture?Which one?The roller disco picture.This one.Oh.Um, .You were here?Yup.Shit, man.I thought you were at least .Well, Im about the same height now as I was then.That other picture, that green one?Yeah?That was taken at that place called Flippers.Do you remember that?It was in Hollywood.Were you in L.A.then?No.Where were you?I was in Detroit.With Ordell?Yeah.We had done some time already.Oh.Were you a.disco guy?Nah.Come on.Dont lie.No, I wasnt.I dont like to dance.Were you ever in one?I went to a few just to meet women, but.it was so loud and I didnt like to dance.During that whole scene, I just drank in bars usually.So who didnt make the cut?Thats a picture of me in Japan.Whose arm is that?Uh, thats the guy that I lived with.His name was Hi-Hiro.Hiro.Hiroshi.He must have made quite an impression.If you count cheese.I never got to know him really.You know, I couldnt speak any Japanese, and his English was terrible.But what am I going to say?His English was better than my Japanese, you know.That sounds like a problem.Not really.You know, we didnt have that much to say to each other anyway.I never really got to know him, but I knew enough to know.that I wasnt missing much, so.Anyway, I keep that picture because, of all the fucking time I was there.thats the only picture Ive got of me in Japan.Thats Japan.Oh.Yeah.Well.Yeah, I can.Yeah, it looks.I could tell.Wanna fuck?Yeah.That was fun.Yeah.Yeah, that really hit the spot.Now we can catch up.Yeah.You got a beer?Yeah, sure.In the fridge.Uh, I mean, damn Me and you forever hand in hand.Im married to the firm, boo You got to understand.Ill die for em Gimme a chair and then Ill fry for em.And if I got to take the stand Im a lie for em Lie for em.Its me and you hand in hand Forever.Im married to the firm, boo You got to understand That we be.Ill die for em Gimme a chair and then Ill fry for em.And if I got to take the stand Im a lie for em Uhh, sugar.Im going to the bar, baby.Jackie Jack!Hey.Damn!Im gonna have to remember this place.This is all right.About two minutes from your crib, ten minutes from the gig.Not bad.Whats your drink, brother?Let me get a screwdriver, home.Howre you doing?Oh, Im fine.Yes, you are.Damn!I bet you come in here on a Saturday night.you need nigger repellant to keep them motherfuckers off your ass.Oh, I do okay.Bullshit, Jackie.Youre a fine motherfucker.I bet you do a damn sight better than okay.You think anybody followed you?I dont think so.But it dont matter, cause they already know Im meeting you.How the fuck they know that?I told them.You told...Here.Keep it.Thank you, sir.You told em its me?They already know its you.Goddamn, that dont mean you got to confirm it.Look, the only way theyre going to give me permission to fly.is if I agree to help em, which is what I have to appear to be doing.So I might as well give them somebody they already know.you.You tell em anything else?Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico, and you want me to bring it in.Goddamn.You told them all that?Its true, aint it?What the fuck that got to do with anything?They know Im delivering for you.I told em about the half mil.They could give a fuck about it.All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns.So I said, Look, you want proof hes getting paid for selling em?Let me bring in the money. And they said?Yes.Hey, whats the matter?I mean, thats what we discussed last night.This is just seeming kind of risky now, you know.Fuck this.Now, let me lay it all out to you, okay?I make two deliveries.the first with .You know, like a dry run?They watch it, see how it works.Then the second delivery, I come home with the half mil.Mm-mm, mm-mm.See, thats too much exposure.Now, I aint goin nowhere near that money.You dont have to.I told them you never pick up the money yourself.You always send someone, and I never know who it is.Thats a good idea.If you listen, its a damn good idea.Now, the first time I do it, theyre looking around.they see me hand the to someone.Who?I dont know.A friend of yours.Like a woman?If you want.Yeah.Yeah, Im thinking a woman.Wait a minute.If theyre gonna let you go.how come we dont bring all the.cash in the first time?Cause I dont trust em.Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils.its gonna look like Im doing the same thing as I did before.But you dont?No.I hand it to someone else first.Hmm.And they follow the wrong one.thinking shes bringing the money to me.Thats the idea.So, we gonna need two women.Can you cover that?Yeah.Yeah, I got the women covered.Where are you planning on pulling this off?The Del Amo Mall, the food court.And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?Its my plan.Were in this together.Yeah, but its my money, and I dont need no fuckin partners.I aint your partner.Im your manager.And Im managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands.and Im managing to do it all under the nose of the cops.So, therefore, Im your manager, and a manager gets %.No, a manager gets ten percent.No, thats an agent.Im gonna give you ten.No.No.A manager gets %, agent gets .Im getting %, all right?All Im gonna give you is ten.And the same deal as before.I can do that.So he says, Fuck that, and moves over into guns.See, you can sell guns wherever theres a demand, and nobody gives a shit.Hes acting like hes this big international arms dealer.when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.Well, he seems to be making out.Is it dead?Yeah.Yeah, well.so far, he is.But you got to admit, hes not too bright.Oh.I wouldnt go so far as to say that.He moves his lips when he reads.What does that tell you?Lets say that hes streetwise, you know.Well give him that.Hes still a fuckup.He killed a man who worked for him the other day.Well.So, what are you trying to tell me?That I should get out of here?Thats not what Im saying at all.You know where he went?He went to go meet that stewardess.Does that bother you?Please!.Well, I dont know.You live with him, so.No, I live here.He just drops in and out.Did he tell you about that half million hes got down in Mexico?Of course he did.He tells anybody whos gonna listen.Well, thats what him and that stewardess are doing.Theyre scheming on how they can get that money over here.And your point is?Let him and the stewardess get the money over here.and then just take it from them.Can I ask you a question?Oh, man.You aint gonna get serious while were in here chilling?No.Its just about Melanie.You know what?Im real sorry about that, man.but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden.I figured, well, shit, Louis aint had no pussy for a while.So I thought, let him kick it here with Mel.So, what she say?She didnt have to say shit.I know Melanie.That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after Im out the door.Melanie real good about throwing a fuck a niggers way.I mean, she aint no damn good at it, but she likes to fuck.Oh, so she aint your girlfriend?Is that what you thought?No, I wasnt sure.I didnt know.But you fucked her anyway?Well.the not your girlfrien part I felt more about.Oh.Well, I hope you felt appropriately guilty afterwards.Afterwards, I did.Oh, oh, shit.But, um.But, like, you know, what is she to you?You know, shes just one of the bitches I got set up.I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach.and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where youre staying.and about four blocks away I got this young -year-old country girl named Sheronda.I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia.barefoot, country as a chicken coop.Took her to my place in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.She believed you?Hell, yeah.To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood.Closest shes ever been, anyway.But you trust Melanie around your business?Oh!.She trying to play your ass against me, aint she?Yeah.Uh-huh.See, I knew it.I knew it.I knew it!See, you didnt have to say nothing.I know that bitch.I dont understand why you keep someone around your business and you cant even trust em.I aint gotta trust her.I know her.I dont know what that means, man.Well, you cant trust Melanie.but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.Well, I dont understand why you keep her the fuck around.I told you, man.Shes my fine little surfer girl.You know, she aint pretty as she used to be.and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to.but she white.You have one message sent at : p.m.Hi, Jackie.Its Max.I was just calling to find out how everything went today at A.T.F.If you want to call me, my home number is.- .Or you can reach me at my office, which is.- .Thats on the card I gave you when we first met.I dont know whether you still have it, but its on it.Oh, let me give you my beeper number.Its - .then dial .Wait for a beep, dial .and hit the pound.Um, okay, so Ill talk to you later.Hope everythings well.Bye-bye.End of message.Now, the moneys gonna be in a Del Amo shopping bag, all right?I

it, a sting.Hes been.Hes been real nice.You think hes got a thing for you?Maybe.But Im thinking its something more like he wants the money for himself.Has he hinted around?No.He just tries to act cool.You know, I dont think theres anything wrong with that.Hes just a young guy having fun being a cop.I know the type.Trust me on this.Hes more interested in Ordell than he is in the money.If he does anything suspect, itll be cutting corners to get the conviction.but he wouldnt walk off with the money, its evidence.And what about you, Max?What?If I was in Nicolets place?No, I mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?You know where it came from.Its not like its somebodys life savings.It wouldnt even be missed.Half a million dollars will always be missed.Youre avoiding the question, Max.Okay, sure, I guess Id be tempted.especially now since Im getting out of the bail bond business.Why?A lot of reasons.I guess the main one would be, uh.Im tired of it.When did you decide?Its been a long time coming.but I finally made up my mind.I guess it was.Thursday.Miss Brown?Yes?Im Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.The night you got me out of jail?Yeah.I went to pick up this guy.I hear hes staying at a house, and, uh.I sneak in, and Im waiting for him.Wait a minute.After we were together, you snuck into a guys house?Yeah.I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun.So, wha?s your name?Sheronda.Sheronda, tha?s a nice name.Sheronda, go ahead.You can eat.Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.All right.I'll be back.I'll check the bag.Stay here.Max, you said it yourself.Ray wants Ordell.He doesn't give a shit about the money.The money won't convict him.Guns will.You're rationalizing.Well, tha?s what you do to go through with the shit you start.You rationalize.I can do it, Max.I know I can.I just can't do it without you.I?s cool.Excuse me, baby.Uh, do you know what time it is?No, ma'am.I ain't got no watch.Oh.Hmm.It could work.If she handles the cops right.it could work.I gave my heart and soul.To you, girl.Didn't I do it, baby.Didn't I do it, baby.What?Jackie Brown.It ain't like I'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.I just want you to go out for a little while while I work this deal.So now you're going to pout!.Now i?s going to take her minutes to find her purse, look for her sandals.find her sunglasses, get outta here.Jackie, Louis.Louis, Jackie.That chick you saw stomping around the back there.tha?s Melanie, who's

Clayton.Wha?s up?that day, I cut my throat.You got that we do it the way I laid out, or we don't do it at all!.What the hell you talkin' about?What the hell I'm talkin' about?Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else.How do you know she did that?I was there!I saw it!You weren't supposed to be there.I knew you would try to pull some shit like that!Hold up!.I ain't pulling no shit!What do you call it, then?I?s my goddamn money!I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.With my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!.If we don't do it my way, then fuck it!Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!.Now chill!Chill!Oh, no!Chill, my ass!No!.Listen!Listen!The woman you saw was my friend Simone.She's the one gonna be receiving the money.I think she oughta see how the shit go down.She's a nice woman.You'll like her.Matter of fact, she's on her way over here right now.Hold up.Louis, call Simone.Tell her to get her ass over here.We're waiting on her.Damn!Is that what you're pissed off about?Oh, just a little pissed?Mm, mm, mm.I'm sorry.I'm about ready for a refill.Are you sure I can't tempt you a little bit more?Come on.Okay, fine.Yeah.You better give me something strong.Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop me at the airport and mark your bills.I don't like that part.It washes off!.I tell `em we do the same thing as before, and they'll follow Sheronda.Yo, Louis.Louis?She ain't there?Yo!No answer?Hmm?Now, you gotta listen to this, man, 'cause this concerns you, all right?Lou!Hmm?Okay, now, this time you're going to get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?Right.The same one Simone gives me, okay?Now, Simone and I make the switch in Billingsley.She knows what I look like?She's seen you with Sheronda, remember?All right.Now, Simone's gonna meet you in the dress department, right?Right.Designer clothes.Right, right, right.The place y'all try shit on.I?s a fitting room.Big sign over the door.You can't miss it.Uh.Why over there?Because they're gonna be watching my ass hard.Tha?s why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open.or even in the dining area.Tha?s why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.Okay.Now, you're going to take.the Billingsley bag Simone gives you and give it to Sheronda.Right.And Simone is going to wait.Then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you.to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.She's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.Hey!See?So, what are you going to be doing during all this?Now that you got `em watching my ass, I'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis.to call me and tell me everything's cool.I got to go!Hey!.Damn!Who's wantin' to page you like that?I?s Ray, the A.T.F.guy.That shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.Ordell has a guy working for him named Louis.You two meet?Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.He was at Ordell's apartment in Hermosa Beach.Yeah.I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.Did you talk to him?Not really.Mm-mm.A fellow named Louis Gara.Just did four years up in Susanville.For what?Bank robbery.We've been following him.He definitely works for Ordell.They did two years together about, I don't know.years ago or so over at Huntsville.He's not living over in Hermosa Beach, though.Ordell's got him staying down at Compton.Living with some -year-old petty thief, some woman named, uh.Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.Hmm.You know her?No.They ever talk about her?Not yet.Okay, who's the other one?Some white chick named Melanie, another girlfriend of Ordell's.Wha?s her deal?It was her coke I got busted with.Oh, yeah?She knows everything.She's not a part of it.and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it.Well, this is definitely somebody I wanna meet.Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?Everything okay?Everything's the same, except for one change.I told him Ordell's changing the amount he's bringing in.Think they bought it?Mm, oh, yeah.I got `em thinking that Ordell's real nervous.and they love thinking that he's scared of `em.You know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.All he needed was a reasonable explanation.Everything's the same, except for one change.Wha?s that?Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money.and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid.So he's sweating a little bit.He's gonna keep his half mil where it is.but he's gonna bring in just in case he needs bail.I?ll be more than that.Don't be so literal.Ray believed it.You still have to show him the money at the airport.I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.He'll see .And where's the rest of it?In the bag, underneath.What if he checks?He won't.He didn't before.He's expecting to see and there it is, on top.You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.Not really.If he finds it, I'll say Mr Walker put it in there.and I didn't know anything about it, like the coke.Well, then you're out.You get nothing.Yeah, but I'm not in jail.and at least I tried.You're going to have surveillance all over you.Tha?s why you don't make a

it was supposed to.How long was she in there?A minute.Not even a minute.She came right out.Louis, you tellin' me the truth?Listen, I swear to God, man.I swear on my life.She came out with that fuckin' bag, and I took it from her.And then what?And that was it.We went to the parking lot.Where you shot her?Tha?s right.Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room somewhere.with a half million dollars.I worked my ass off to get waitin' for you?Fuck you for asking me that.I know the bitch tried to set me up.Fuck you, brother.How could you fuckin' ask me that?She didn't ask you?Shit!.Pull the car over a minute.Why'd you ask me that?All right, so where's the gun you shot her with?I?s in there.Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?I coulve taken two out already.I?s Jackie Brown.Well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch before I blow her brains out.Well, maybe the Feds got it.Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.See, if there wasn't nothin'.in that bag but them towels.then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money.out of her suitcase and the A.T.F.got it.But she put them books in there to trick our ass.Well, tha?s why I didn't check it.Because the bag felt right.Tha?s right.And then she puts grand or so in there.to rub that shit in my face.You know what I'm sayin'?She wants me to know she ripped me off.Ah.I don.I don.You know, I don't know.I don't know.Unless, you know, either she's got it or the Feds got it.Or.Or.Now, check this out.What if she gave the money to somebody else first.before Melanie even went in the dressing room.Uh-huh.Oh, man.You know what?What?Do you know who I saw in the dress department?No, tell me.I didn't think anything of it.I.No, no, I did wonder.what he was doin' there.I wondered what he was doin' there, but I thought it had.nothin' to do with us.Like, maybe he was with his wife or his girlfriend.I?s a big place.Louis, Louis, Louis!You gonna tell me who you saw?Yeah, Max Cherry.Max Che.You seen Max Cherry in the dress department where we.Man, look at me when I'm talkin' to you!.You see that motherfucker in the dress department when we.about to get a half million dollars.And you don't think nothin' about him bein' there?No.Do they know each other?Hell, yeah, they know each other.He bonded her ass out of County.Well, how am I supposed to know that?You know your bail bondsmen.You know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?Why should I think something's weird if I don't know nothin'.about them knowin' each other?I don't wanna hear no fuckin' excuses, Louis.I ain't givin' you excuses.But I'm tellin' you.I don't fuckin'.I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.Oh, you gonna tell me the reason.you lost every goddamned cent I got in the world?Hey.Hey, man.You gonna tell me reasons?You better.Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker.The reason is your ass ain't worth a shit no more.You better fuckin' back off, man.What the fuck happened to you, man?Your ass used to be beautiful.You didn't tell me you were goin' shoppin'.I thought I did.Yeah, well, you didn't.You know, if i?s me.and I got all that shit hangin' over my head like you got hangin' over yours.I don't know, I'd go shoppin' later.Well, I got there early.You see, I've had my eye on this suit.that I've wanted, and, well, I'm just gonna go try it on.Wait a minute.Wait a minute.Wait, wait, wait.Just wait a minute.Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?Let me finish.I got there early.The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it.If I did, they would wrap it up, and I would put back on my uniform.'cause Sheronda is expecting me to wear it.Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $ and go home.Yeah, but you didn't do that.Because I couldn't.Ray, I swear.Melanie burst in.She grabbed the bag.And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it.What happened to the bag she gave you?She didn't give me a bag.Melanie was not a part of the plan.Ordell probably told her to do it.Tha?s why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.But I couldn't go after her, because I was in my fucking underwear.And I had to put on this suit because I could put it on faster than my uniform.You had time to pay the sales chick.I had to.Ray, I was frantic.What was I supposed to do?All right, what you do after that?I went lookin' for you.And I went back to the place in the mall.where you were before, but you weren't there.What was I supposed to do if something happens?You didn't tell me how to do that.There was a guy with Melanie?There was nobody in the fitting room.Okay.You've no idea what happened to the $ .You're clueless, right?You've no idea where the grand is?I have no idea.None.You have no idea.None.It coulve gone here, coulve gone there?I know nothin'.Not a clue.I don't have an idea where the motherfuckin' money is.Not even a little idea.A maybe.Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.You'd take a polygraph?Yeah, if i?d motherfuckin' make you happy!.Yeah, put it right there.I'll do it.Man.I sure hope you didn't do anything stupid, Jackie.I gotta talk to you for a second.Fuck.Louis Gara's dead.L.A.P.D.found him shot in the car on Ninth.And we lost Ordell.I thought you were fuckin' watchin' him.We were, and we lost him.He walked into a strip bar sometime around : and never came out.The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found Louis.It looks like Louis' buddy shot him twice, point-blank range.So wha?s gonna happen now?We pick up Ordell.We got three murders we can link him to, and we got you.What about me?What about you?You think I took some of that money?Hey, I have no evidence of you doin' anything.You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills.I'm glad to see that.You've been helpin' us out.You gave us Melanie.You gave us Louis.Melanie was found with a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.That goes a long way in backing up your story.I'll settle for Ordell with marked bills.But if there's anything else.you haven't told me about, you know what, tha?s between you and Ordell.I just got one thing to say.You better hope we find him before he finds you.No, no, no, I done told you, I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr Walker.I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till I get my motherfuckin' money.Come on, man.If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.Oh,

man.Well, where he at?Out of town?He's around, man.Well, give me his home number.No, I'll give you his beeper number!.All right.Break out the beeper number, nigger.Yeah.I've been looking for you.Do you know who this is?This is Mr Robbie, isn't it?I have your .Tha?s why you called.The bond collateral that you put down on Beaumont Livingston.and moved over to Miss Brown, remember?Oh, she got off, did she?They decided to no-file this morning.Tell me where you are.I'll come give you your money.You still there?Look here, man.I know you helped her.And I know you know what I want.And Jackie can tell me any story comes into her pretty little head.as long as at the end of that story she hands me my motherfuckin' money.Now, she wanna be my friend, she do that.She don't want to be my friend no more.well, you just tell her to think about old Beaumont.And if she go to the police.you tell her I will name her ass as my accessory.And we'll go upstate, hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.And tha?s a promise.Do you understand what I'm sayin'?You tell her that, and I'll call you back.You're right.It was Ordell.If you have time, do you think you could find out where he's stayin' for me?Cops can't locate him, huh?They don't have your winning personality.Sure thing.I don't have to know what I'm doing, just as long as you know.I think I do.Good enough?You bet.Fuck's wrong with you, knockin'

your money.If she didn't, there'd be cops batteramming your door down right now.How'd you find me, anyway?Winston found you.How'd he find me?Tha?s what he does.He finds people that don't wanna be found.Oh, well, bully for that nigger.So, she wanna give me my money, huh?Yeah.She wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.She also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.Oh, and I wanna hear that shit too.Turn around.Put your hands on your head.Why don't you tell me why?Jackie didn't trust Melanie.She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her.split the half million amongst themselves.What she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.And you helped her, didn't you?All I did was walk out with it.Y'all went to all that trouble just to protect my interest?In a way, yes.My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumb ass.Go over there and sit on that couch.Don't worry about her.She don't even know you're here.Sit down.Place stinks.You get used to it.Where my money at?My office.Where Jackie at?She's been there since Thursday night.If she want to talk to me, how come she wasn't home?She's afraid.Oh, right.That I gotta see.She still

got her spooked.She won't leave there till you get your money and you're gone.Oh, you expect me to just go walkin' in there?If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.When you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.She believed you.Mmm.Then tha?s why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?It ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?See, I ain't trust Melanie either, but I could handle her.That was my little blonde-haired surfer girl.And I told that fuckin' Louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth.But no, he had to shoot her.Jackie's at your office, huh?Uh-huh.She by herself?That big-ass nigger Winston ain't there, is he?She's all alone.All right.I call over there, she better answer the phone.She

Domergue.Domergue, to you, this is Maj.Warren.Howdy nigger!She's a pepper, ain't she?Now girl, don't you know darkee's don't like bein' called niggers no more.They find it offensive.- I been called worse.- Now that I can believe.- Heard of her?- Should I?Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth, but.maybe you might of heard tell 'bout the price on her head.- How much?- Ten thousand dollars.Damn, what she do?Kill Lily Langtree?Not quite.Now that ten thousand's practically in my pocket.It's why I ain't too anxious to be handin' out rides.Especially to professionals open for business.Well I certainly can appreciate that.I ain't got no designs on her.One of my fella's over there is worth four thousand, one's worth three, and one's worth one.That's damn sure good enough for me.Well.Let me see their paperwork.Like I said, molasses-like.Back off.Look.I sure hate to interrupt y'all!But we gtta' cold damn blizzard, hot on our asses we tryin' to beat to shelter!I realize that!Now shut your mouth and hold them damn horses while I think!Okay boy, we'll give it a try.But you leave those pistols over yonder with the driver.You ain't really gonna' let that nigger ridin' in here is ya'?I mean maybe up there with O.B., but- How you like the sound of them bells, bitch?They are real pretty, ain't they?You open up your trashy mouth again, I'll knock out them front teeth for ya'.You got it?Yeah.Let me hear you say: "I got it." I got it.Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin' these fella's up on the roof.Give O.B.fifty dollars when ya' get to Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.Well, I agree with O.B.This storm's got me concerned.We get goin' a lot quicker you help out too.Goddamit to hell, I'm already regretting this!Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.And my wrist is gonna' stay cuffed to hers, and she ain't never gonna' leave my goddamn side, until I personally put her in the Red Rock jail!Now do you got that?- Yeah, I got it.- Good.Translation/Timings/Creator by: Deluce So what happend to your horse?He got old.I done had him for a bit.When the weather took a turn for the worse, he done what he could, but he couldn't make it.- That's too bad.- Yes it is.Me an' ole Lash rode a lotta' miles together.You could say he was my best friend- if I considered stupid animals firends, which I don't.Never the less.I'm gonna' miss 'em.Who's Daisy Domergue?A no damn good murdering bitch, that's who.I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope.- If by woman, you mean her?No I do not have mixed emotions.So you takin' her into Red Rock to hang?- You bet.- Gonna' wait to watch it?You know I am.I wanna' hear her neck snap with my own two ears.You never wait to watch 'em hang?My bounties never hang, cause I never bring 'em in alive.Never?Never ever.We talked about this in Chattanooga.Bringing desperate men in alive, is a good way to get yourself dead.Can't catch me sleepin' if I don't close my eyes.I don't wanna' work that hard.No one said the job was suppose to be easy.No one said it was suppose to be that hard, nether.But that little lady, is why they call him "The Hangman".When the handbill says Dead or Alive, the rest of us shoot ya' in the back from up on top of a perch somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya', you don't die by a bullet in the back.When The Hangman catches you.you hang.You overrate 'em nigger.I'll give you he got guts.But in the brains department, he like a man who took a high dive in a low well.Now Daisy, I want us to work out a signal system of communication.When I elbow you real hard in the face.that means: Shut up.You got it?I got it.I.I know we only met each other once before.And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy.But.Well.You still got it?I still got, what?The Lincoln letter?Of course.Do you got it on you?Where?Right here.Look, I know you gotta' be real careful with it and all.I can imagine you probably don't like to take it in an'out of the envelope all that often.But if you wouldn't mind, i'd sure appreciate seein' that again.You right, I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much.- Yeah.- But.as your saving my life an' all, I suppose I could let you read it again."Ole Mary Todd's callin', so I guess it must be time for bed" Ole Mary Todd.That gets me.That gets me too.You know what this is, tramp?It's a letter from Lincoln.It's a letter from Lincoln to him.They shared a correspondence during the war.They was pen pals.This is just one of the letters.What the.O.B.Stop!Whoa, easy.Of all the stupid, like to rip my goddamn arm off!I didn't, drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain, just for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town.You the one handed her my goddamn letter.I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you!That nigger like to bust my jaw.You ruin that letter of his, that niggers gonna' stomp your ass to death.And when he do, I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh.How is it?She didn't help it none.But it's alright.Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?You.ain't no goddamn.lady!Hey Mister Ruth?What?There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!What?I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!Considering there's a blizzard goin' on, whole lotta' fellas walkin' around, wouldn't you say, Major?Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah.seems to be a lot of 'em.This changes things, son.Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger.But with a partner, eighteen's a whole lot better.You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'?Or her?- Put them on.- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.You put those on or you can stop worryin' about this whole thing, right now.Chapter Two Son of a Gun Hand your weapons to the driver.Little jumpy, ain't you?Never mind the jokes, just do it.- If you say so.- I do.Okay.I done did it.O.B.?Ya' got 'em?- I got 'em!- Okay fella', you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand, and you keep that other hand where I can see it.Walk over there where I can get a good look at cha'.I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.Is that you Chris Mannix?- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?- Not quite.- You know this fella'?- Only by reputation.Like I said friend, you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.Keepin' you at a disadvantage, is a advantage I intend to keep.Whoever you are mister, you sure sound tough when you're talkin' to a desperate man knee deep in snow.I don't want no trouble.I just wanna' ride.I'm freezin to death.Who is this joker.You heard of the rebel renegade Erskine Mannix?- Mannix's Marauders?- That's them.The scourge of South Carolina, Mannix Marauders.That's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?Well Mr.Face, I was riding to Red Rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow, fucked up his leg, an' had to put 'er down.You got business in Red Rock?- Yes I do.- What?I'm the new sheriff.- Horseshit.- 'fraid not.- Where is your star?- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.Once I get there they swear me in, but that ain't happened yet.And that's when you get your star.You got anything that can back any of this up?Yeah.When we get to Red Rock.And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there, I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business.And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?Three dead.One alive.- Who's that?- Daisy Domergue.Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except me and the hangman.The Hangman?Well I'll be double dogged damned.- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.- It's John.And you.your're the nigger with the head.Major Marquis.My lord, is that really the real head of Major Marquis, lookin' at me now?Yeah it's really me and it's really my head.What's goin' on, y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic?Never mind, you takin' in them three dead bodies and her to Red Rock to get paid, ain't ya'?Yeah.Well.the man is red Rock suppose to pay you is me.The new sherrif.So if you wanna get paid, you need to get me to Red Rock.Well execuse me for findin' it hard to belive a town electin' you to do anything except drop dead.So I'm suppose to freeze death, 'cause you find something hard to belive?No I suppose not.Put them on and come inside.No.- Then you'll freeze.- Then you'll hang.How so?Driver!Could you come down here and join us?I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here.You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?Yeah.Red Rock is my town.And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains?No Sir!Sorry bushwackers, I ain't entering Red Rock that way.When you finally get to Red Rock, you're going to realize every goddamn thing I said was right.And I expect you, O.B., to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock that John Ruth, let their new sheriff freeze to death.There ain't no bounty on my head, bushwacker.You let me die, that's murder.Hold out your hands.O.B.Give the Major back his iron.One thing I know for sure, this nigger-hatin' son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.Now.I'll help protect your eight thousand, you help me protect my ten, deal?Ain't love grand.Y'all wanna' lie on the ground and make snow angels together?- Tell ya' what, Bob- - The name's John.When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and Major Marquis there dinner and booze.- May way of sayin' thanks.- I don't drink, with rebel renegades, and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.Well Mr.Ruth, you sound like you got a axe to grind against The Cause.The cause of a renegade army?A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the Rebel Flag as an excuse to kill and steal.And this should interest you Warren, imparticular emancipated blacks.Sounds like my kinda' fella'.Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta' newspapers printed in Washington D.C.Anywho, I'm just tryin' to let y'all know grateful I am.I was a goner, and y'all saved me.You wanna' show me how grateful you are.shut up!God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.Here, last piece.Does he know how famous you once was?I don't think so.Black eye.Do you know who he is?Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the Confederacy put on the head of Major Marquis?Yeah.Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?No they didn't.But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.Them peckawoods left their homes and their families, and come to this snowy mountain, lookin' for me and fortune.None of them found fortune.The ones you ain't ever heard of no more, they found me.Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war.Once passions had colled, it dropped down to eight, then five.But, I bet even when it was five thousand, you had your share of country boys comin' to call?You know I did.Why did they have a reward on you?The Confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them.After I broke out of Wellenbeck, The South took my continued existence as a personal affront.So The Cause put a reward on my head.What's.Wellenbeck?You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!You bust out?Maj.Marquis did more than bust out.Maj.Marquis had a bright idea.So bright.you got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before.Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling.So I burnt it down.There was a rookie regiment spendin' the overnight in that camp.Forty-seven men.burnt to a crisp.Southern youth, farmer's sons, - cream of the crop- - And I say, "Let 'em burn".I'm suppose to apologize for killin' Johnny Reb?You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.I joined the war to kill White Southern Crackers And that means kill 'em anyway I can.Shoot 'em.Stab 'em.Drown 'em.Burn 'em.Drop a big ole' rock on their head.Whatever it took to put White Southern Crackers in the ground that's what I joined the war to do, and that's what I did.To answer your question, John Ruth, when Major Marquis burned forty seven men alive, for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees, that's when The South put a reward on the head of Major Marquis.And I made them trees, Mannix.And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed The Northern Line.But you had a surprise waitin' for you on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck, seems not all of them boys were Rebs.You burnt up some of your own boys, didn't ya' Major?How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'?Wasn't the final Yankee death count somethin' like thirty-seven?That's the thing about war Mannix, people die.So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with.But if memory serves, your side didn't look at it that way.I think they thought, thirty-seven white men for one nigger wasn't so hot a trade.I belive they accused you of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks and the whole Blue and Grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.And that's why they drummed your black ass outta' the Cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back.Isn't it Major?Horse shit.If he did all that, the Cavalry woulda' shot him.I didn't say they could prove it.But they sure did think it out loud, didn't they Major?But, Warren's war record was stellar, and that's what saved his ass.Are you killed yourself your share of redskins in your day, didn't ya' Black Major?Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.I'll tell a' what The Cavalry didn't look kindly on.Mannix's Marauders that's what.And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy would talk about anybody else's behavior during war time makes me wanna horse laugh.Don't you say anything about my daddy, what he fought for, was dignity in defeat, and against the unconditional surrender.We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls.We were your brothers.- We deserved dignity in defeat.- Just, how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat?My faire share, Black Major.'Cuz when niggers are scared, that's when white folks are safe.You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk, you ride up top wtih O.B.No no no, you got me talkin' politics I didn't wanna'.Like I said y'all, I'm just happy to be alive.I.I think I'll just look out this winda' let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep.And dream about how lucky I am.Chapter Three Minnie's Haberdashery Get in there.Easy.What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight?I can see you already got another one up in here.I just got through putting the horses away.This ain't the normal line.But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard, so it looks like you're stuck with us.Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?They ain't here.I'm running the place while they're gone.Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?He says they ain't here.He's lookin' after the place while they gone.Who are you?I'm Bob.Well whoever you are, help O.B.with the horses.Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em.I just put those other horses away.You need it done fast, you need to help.I got two of my best men on it.You heard him freeloaders, get to work.Come on let's go!- Open up!- Kick it open!- What?- Kick it open!Shut that door, there's a goddamn blizzard out there!- You gotta' nail it shut!- You have to nail it shut!- Hold it shut!- There's a hammer and nails by the door!You have to nail it shut!There's a hammer and nails by the door!- Give me a hammer.- Yeah.You need to do two pieces of wood!One ain't good enough!- Two pieces of wood.- That fuckin' thing is busted!Not just one piece of wood.- Gimme that other piece of wood.- Yeah, allright.- Gimme the nail.- Here.Jesus.That door's a son of a gun.Who's the idiot who broke that, that Mexican fella'?Good heavens, a woman out in this white hell.You must be frozen solid, poor thing.Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.When did you fella's arrive?About forty minutes ago.The Cowboy fella' in the courner, is that your driver?No he's a passenger.The driver lit out.He said he was going to spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend.Jesus Christ, that's awful!Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella' do, soak his ole socks in the pot?I think we all felt the same way, but were a little too polite to say something.- He don't have that problem..Where's the well water?Over there.So, all three of you fellas' headed to Red Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?Yes, all three of us were on that stagecouch out there.Coffybeans?Over there.Get your hand outta' there.The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with us.Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.If he is a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.Good.Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable.So.the new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with you?No he's lyin' he ain't sheriff of nothin' He's a southern renegade.He's just talkin' his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.What the fuck I tell you about talkin', huh?I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck!You never gave your name, sir.John Ruth.- Are you a lawman?- I'm takin' her to the law.- You're a bounty hunter?- That's right, Buster.- Do you have a warrant?- 'Course I do.May I see it?Why?You're suppose to produce it upon request.How am I suppose to know, you're not a villain, kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession?What's your name, Buster?Well.it certainly isn't Buster.It's Oswaldo Mobray.- Oswaldo?- Yes.Well.I got my warrant, Oswaldo.- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?- Yeah it's her.- It says here, Dead or Alive?- Yeah it does.Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her sounds like hard work.Wouldn't transporting her be easier if she were dead?No one said the job was suppose to be easy.And why is her hanging proper, so important to you?Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman.He's gotta' make a living too.Well I appreciate that.Allow me to properly introduce myself.I'm Oswaldo Mobray, The Hangman in these parts.- Looks like I brought you a customer.- So it would appear.Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers?No I can't say I have.Don't talk to my prisoner.I talk to my prisoner, that's it.You got it?I got I got.Jolly good.You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up?The Bar is open, follow moi.All right.All right.Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!I'll feed and water the horses.You go inside and get some hot coffy.I've got some stew cooking.Should be done soon.Now look.now matter how bad this blizzard gets, we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time.So me an' Chris better lay out a line from the stable to the front door, and from the front door to the shithouse.Okay?Good idea.Come on, Chris.I'll give you a hand.No no no, go inside, get warm.You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?You're right, mi amigo.Muchas gracias.All right, follow me.We gonna' drop one, every ten paces.- From here to the door.- Yeah!- All right.Now, you're wanted for murder.For the sake of my analogy, let's just assume that you did it.John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock to stand trail for murder.And, if.you're found guilty, the people of Red Rock will hang you in the town square.And as the hangman, I will perform the execution.And if all those things end up taking place, that's what civilized society calls "justice".However, if the relatives and the loved ones of the person you murdered were outside that door right now.And after busting down that door, they drug you out in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that, we would be frontier justice.Now the good part about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching.The bad part is it's apt to be Wrong as Right.Not in your case.In your case, you'd have it comin'.But other people, maybe not so much.But ultimately what's the real difference between the two?The real difference is Me.The Hangman.To me, it dosen't matter what you did.When I hang you, I will get no satisfaction from your death.It's my job.I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there.The man who pulls the lever, that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man.And that dispassion is the very essence of justice.For justice delivered without dispassion, is always in danger of not being justice.Amen.No offense cowboy fella', just gettin' your attention.Yeah, well.you got it.What'cha writing firend?- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.- What's that?My life story.- You're writing your life story?- You bet I am.Am I in it?You just entered.Well you like writing stories so much, why don't you tell me the story that brings you here?- Who's askin'?- I am.John Ruth.I'm bringin' in this one to Red Rock to hang.Ain't no way I'm spendin' a coupla' nights under a roof with somebody I don't know who you they are.And I don't know who you are.So.who are you?- Joe Gage.- What?That's my name, Joe Gage.Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?- I ain't goin' to Red Rock.- Where you goin'?- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.- What's there?My mother.Your mother?Listen, I'm just a cow puncher I just.I got back from a long drive and.I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time, I was a partner.For the first time in my life I, made a pretty penny and, eh.Come home and spend time with my mother for Christmas.Now that's funny.'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type.Yeah, well.you know, looks can be deceiving.Because I definitely am a.coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type.Christmas with Mother?I mean.it's a wonderful thing.Now is that.good enough for you?John Ruth?For now.Just steer clear of my prisoner.Hello old timer.General.General.You sir, are a Hyena.And I have no wish to speak to you.I've been called worse.Fair enough, General.Sorry to bother you.- You gonna' kick it open.- Kick it open.It's already cold enough in here.It dosen't have latch you gonna' hammer up a board.You gotta' nail it shut!- The hammer and nails is by the door.- There is a hammer and nails right there!Oh god, - Holdin' this Chris.- Here, here.You need to nail it in!You need two pieces of wood.You gotta' hammer another one.One ain't good enough!It's gonna' blow right open.- Goddamn it!- It's gotta' open if you don't.- Shut up!- I got it!Son of a bitch!Jesis Christ, that door's a whore!I get it, haberdashery, that was a joke.How's the coffy?Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.Thank you.Guess who he is?Buffalo Bill?Hardly, no.- I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The- - He's the hangman of Red Rock.- Oh, you are?- Yes I am.Well good to meet you Mr.?- Mobray.- Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix, - the new sheriff in Red Rock.- Really?Horseshit!- Pay no attention to him.- Horseshit!Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.That's the only thing you said that's the truth.You comin' into Red Rock to hang Lance Lawson?Precisely.- Do you have the execution orders on you?- In my beg.- May I see 'em?- Of course.Who's Lance Lawson?He's a fell' been sittin' in the Red Rock jail about a month now.He's the fella - who shot the fella' - who was sheriff 'fore me.Precisely.What did she mean when she said, bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable?He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable.But all that just to guard her?I don't think that was the original idea, but.that's the idea now.- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?- Yeah.Five of you?Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.Yes it does.Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?The Lincoln what?The letter from Abraham Lincoln?President Abraham Lincoln?- Weren't you pen pals?- With the President?I'm sorry, I heard somebody in your party had a letter from Abraham Lincoln, I assumed it was you.Not him!The black fella' in the stable.The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?Yeah.The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?Say your name was again?- Bob.- Warren.Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain.- What?- Yeah.- They ain't here?- Yes, they're visiting her mother.- Her mother?- Yes.I never knew Minnie had a mother.Everybody's got a mother.Yeah, I suppose.- And she left you in charge?- Si.That sure don't sound like Minnie.Are you callin' me a liar?Not yet, I ain't.- But it sounds peculiar, though, - What sound peculiar?Well first of, Minnie never struck me as the sentimental type.Secondly, I can't imagine Sweet Dave liftin' his fat ass outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water, unless Minnie was layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.Along takin' trips to the north side.That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar, mi negro amigo.Yeah it do sound a whole lot like, don't it?But I still haven't done it yet.Minnie still serve food?- Do you consider stew food?- Yes.- Then we serve food.She still stinkin' up the place with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.She rolls her own."Red Apple Tobacco" But mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.Yeah I do, Senor Bob.Just seein' if you do.- Fill me up, O.B.- Yeah.Goddamn it!Thank you.Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty.is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?You've got a good eye son.Well, I'll be double dogged damned!General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.- Erskine's boy?- Yes sir.May I sit down, Sir?According to the Yankees, it's a free country.Genaral Sandy Smithers.boy.oh boy.Did my daddy talk about you.I heard you gave those Blue Bellies sweet hell.Me and my boys did our part.Just like Erskine and his boys did their part.Hell yeah, we did.- Yankees sons of bitches?- I never knew your father, son.But, I always respected his resolve.Thank you for saying that, General.Your respect woulda' meant the world to him.Can I get ya' some coffy?- That would be nice.- Well, how about a blanked?That would be even nicer.Hell, you know what, you can have mine.Here we go General.So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?If ya' don't mind me askin'?My boy.You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?My son, Chester Charles Smithers, he died out here a few years back.Forgive me sir.No forgiveness needed, son.Like I said, it was a few years back.It was after he served his service.He came out here to the hills of Wyoming, to make his fortune.Never to be heard from again.I bought him a symbolic plot in the Red Rock cemetery.I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone.Was he a goner fer' sure?No chance he could be livin' "the cold life" out in the woods?It's a rough life, but folks can learn it.If he had done what he came here to do, he'd a come home.Close it, close it!You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut!Really?Who's the idiot who broke the damn door?Fucking hold it low.Okay.Hold it, mi negro amigo.We need two pieces of wood.Ola mi cabron.There you go, motherfucker!- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?- Huh?Considering Minnie's no hats indoors policy?Which, If I remember it correctly, that was one of them Bar of Iron rules, kinda rule, she'd want kept up in her absence.You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats.I'm guilty.I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats.How about we forget about the hats today, considering there's a blizzard going on and all, and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?A large black dog.Labrador.You know my daddy, I said that my daddy!Always said that Davis was a courages man.But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond.Yes, Sir.I agree with that the army in North Virginia would've been used in a.I said the army of North Virginia would have been used in very different way.Shut up!O.B.?Do you know that nigger, Sir?I don't know that nigger.But I know he's a nigger.And that's all I need to know.Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.- That nigger is- - General Sanford Smithers?Battle of Baton Rouge?Inform the nigger in the Cavalry officers uniform that I had a division of Confederates under my commend, in Baton Rouge.Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to inform you.I heard 'em hillbilly.Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also.On the other side.Oh that's interesting.General Smithers, he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.- On the other- - Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger, that I don't acknowledge niggers in Northern uniforms.You captured a whole Colored Command that day.But not one Colored Trooper made it to a camp, did they?We had neither the time or the food.Nor the inclination to care for Northern horses, and least of all Northern niggers.- So we shot 'em where they stood.- Gentlemen, Gentlemen, I know Americans aren't apt to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war.But I strongly suggest we don't restage The Battle of Baton Rouge, during a blizzard in Minnie's Haberdashery.Now, my Nubian friend, while I realize passions are high, that was a while ago.And if you shoot this un-armed old man I guarantee I will hang you by the neck until you are dead.Once we arrive in Red Rock.I damn will guarantee that too.Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men.You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's a accident, but ya' can't just shoot 'em.Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here, close together like for a few days, may I suggest a possible solution?We divide Minnie's in half.The Northern side and The Southern Side.With the dinner table operating as a neutral territory.We could say that the fireplace side of the room, acts as a symbolic representative of.Georgia While the bar, represents.Philadelphia!As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon?I help you protect your eight thousand, you help me protect my ten?One of them fella's is not what he says he is.What is he?He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is.One of them, maybe even two of 'em, is here to see Domergue goes free.And to accomplish that goal, they'll kill everbody in here.And they got 'em coupla' days.So all they gotta' do is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity.And that's when they strike, huh bitch?If you say so, John.Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?Our best bet is this, duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait.But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing it's the right one, isn't so easy.If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.He'll try and create his opportunity.And that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.And what do you got to say about all this?What do I got to say?About John Ruth's ravings?He's absolutely right.Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots.And we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep.That's when we gonna' kill y'all.Okay everybody, hear this.This here is Daisy Domergue.She's wanted dead or alive for murder.Ten thousand dollars.That money's mine boys.Don't wanna' share it.I ain't gonna' lose it.When the sun comes out, I'm taking this woman into Red Rock, to hang.Now.is there anybody here.comitted to stopping me`.from doing that?Really?Nobody gotta' problem with this?Well, I guess that's very fortunate for me.However, I hope you all understand, I can't just take your word.Circumstances force me to, take.precautions.When you say precautions.why do I feel you mean me?- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.- You are?- Yes I am.- Nothing personal.- Just mine?The Hangman got himself a gun too?I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours.I feel kinda' naked without it.Oh, I still got mine.I'll protect you.A bastards work is never done, huh, John Ruth?That's right, Joe Gage.- Now gimmie the gun.- You want it?You have to come and take- Calm down.Take your hand away from your gun.Blink if you're calm.- Did he blink?- He blinked.Blink if your gonna' remain calm?- He blinked.- Take his pistol.I'm real sorry about this, son.Like I said, nothing personal.Just a precaution.Pretty sneaky.I'm afraid the same applies to you too, Mr.Mobray.Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose.Hand me that little bucket.O.B.?Go to the outhouse.Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole.Why do I gotta' go outside?Your jacket's already on.And I sorta kinda trust you.After you Major.Okay.I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.Don't get any ideas, I ain't goin' soft on ya'.You lift your ass even one inch off this seat, I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat.So Domergue, I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned?- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?- No I sure don't.How 'bout you Oswaldo?How about me what?Look, considerin' all the thing I done for money, I ain't one to judge.But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?Till they invent a trigger a woman can't pull, if you're a hang man, you're going to hang woman.Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before.When it comes to some of them mean bastards out therem it's the only thing does the job.You really only need to hang mean bastards.But mean bastards, you need to hang.You goddamn son of a bitch!I almost died out there!I ain't never going out in that shit ever, ever again!You okay, O.B.?I'm fine.I'll be fine.I just need to get warm.You want some stew, O.B.?Stew, later.That's nice.So.- how you doin', black Major?I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.Leave me be from your horseshit.John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?I tole' you jackass to Hee-Haw somewhere else.That's right, John.- You did say, didn't ya'?- Yeah I did.So.- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?- Yes.Thee Abraham Lincoln?Yes.Abraham Lincoln The President of the United States.- Yes.- Of America?- Yes.- Wrote you a letter, personally?- Yes.- Personally?As in: "Dear Maj.Warren"?- No.Personally as in: "Dear Marquis"."Dear Marquis" Abraham Lincoln the President of the United States of America?Yes.- May I see it?- No you may not.But the way John tells it, you weren't just some random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters.Way John tells it, - y'all hada' correspondence.- Yes.Way John tells it, y'all's practically pen pals?Yes.And a pen pal's.practically a friend.John Ruth, you really think a nigger drummed outta' the Calvary with a yellow stripe down his back, was practically friends with The President of The United States of America?John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery, had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln, Least of all, that nigger there.Was all that horseshit?Course it was.Well I guess it's true what they say about you people.You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth.What's the matter, John Ruth?I hurt your feelings?As a matter of fact, you did.I know, I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.But you got no idea, what it's like being a black man facin' down America.The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed.And this letter, had the desired effect of disarming white folks.Call it what you want, I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man?Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John, a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me.- I might let a whore piss on it.- I spit on it.Good for you, sister.Warren goddamit, you leave that old man alone!Stand down you son of a bitch, I shared a battle field with this man.Or would you deny me that too?I suppose you were there.May I join you?Yes you may.Damn it.So, how's life since the war?Got both my legs.Got both my arms.- I can't complain.- Got a woman?Fever took her, started this last winter.What was her name?- Betsy.- Georgia girl?Augusta.Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.I use to raise Kentucky horses.Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies.God damnit.I made good deal on her.Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards.Set myself up pretty well.Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.Yeah, your son came up here a few years back.He spoke highly of his mama too.You knew my boy?Yeah.Yeah I knew 'em.You did not know my boy.Suit yourself.Didja' know my son?I know the day he died, - do you?- No.You wanna know what day that was?The day he met me.He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'.By then the reward was so, five thousand and bragging rights.But back then to battle hard rebs, five thousand just to cut off a niggers head, now that's good money.So the Johnny's climbed this mountain, lookin' for fortune.But there was no fortune to be found.All they found was me.All them fella's came up here sang a different tune, when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun, "Let's just forget it.I go my way, you go yours" - that's your boy Chester talkin' - You a goddamn lie."If you just let me home to my family, I'll swear, I'll never set foot in Wyoming again." That's what they all said.Beggin' for his life.Your boy told me his whole life story.And you was in that story, General.And when I knew me I had the son.Of The Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge.- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!General Smithers, don't you listen to him, he didn't know your boy!He just heard, tell why you here is all!It was cold the day I killed your boy.And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold.It was colder than that.And on that cold day, with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel.I made him strip.Right down to his bare ass.Then I told him to start walkin'.I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him.- You never even knew my boy?- No he didn't!He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!Then he commits to begging again.But this time he wasn't begging to go home.He knew he'd never see his home again.And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.'Cos he knew that was long gone.All he wanted.was a blanket.Now don't judge your boy too harshly, General.You ain't never been cold as your boy was that day.You'd be surprised what a man that cold, would do for a blanket.Wanna know what your boy did?I took my big, black, pecker outta' my pants.And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it.Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head.Then I stuck my big, black Johnson right down his goddamn throat.And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.You bet your sweet ass it was warm.And Chester Charles Smithers, sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could.Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?Your boy.black dudes dingus in his mouth.Him shakin', him cryin' me laughin' and him not understandin' But you understand, doncha' Sandy?I never did give your boy that blanket.Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked.No blanket.That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise.Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers, that you chose not to acknowledge.So what you gonna' do old man?You gonna' spend the next two or three days, ignore the nigger that killed your boy, Ignoring how I made him suffer?Ignoring how I made him.lick, all over my Johnson?The dumbest thing your boy ever did.was to let me know.he was your boy.Chapter Four Domergue's Got a Secret About fifteen minutes has passed, since we last left our characters.Joe Gag volunteered to take Smithers dead body outside.Straws we drawn to see who would help him.O.B.lost.Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo, had vigorous debate about the legality of self-defense murder they just transpired.Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the legality of what just transpired, ignored them sat at a table by himself and drank brandy.Captain Chris Mannix dawn the dead Generals coat and joined Oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns.Hey Ozzy, hey you got the right idea.Let's light this place up.John Ruth held the door close, waiting for Joe Gage and O.B.to return.Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.Domergue, however, hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.John Ruth.Yeah?Can I play that guitar over there?Let's go back a bit.Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot General Smithers in front of everybody.But fourty seconds before that, something equally as important happened, but not everybody saw it.While Major Warren was captivating the crowd with tales of black dicks and white mouths.somebody.poisoned the coffy.He did everything I asked, no blanket.And the only one to see 'em do it.was Domergue.That's why this chapter is called.Domergue's Got a Secret.John Ruth.Yeah.Can I play that guitar over there?Yeah.You come back with anything else but a guitar.My pistol plays a tune.Domergues death march, you got it?Yeah, yeah, yeah.I got it.That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh?Yeah.It's kinda' pretty.- Got another verse to it?- Yeah I got.Go ahead, sing it.Gimme that guitar!Music time's over!Turn around.- No, no, no, no, no.- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!When you get to hell, John.Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.Mannix the coffy!Oh my god!Gimme that fucking gun!Don't test me, bitch.Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder.Goddamit- Get or don't get, Joe Gage.It's up to you.- I'll get.- Then get.You too, Senor Bob.Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall.Move 'em down snowshoes.Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say.You open your mouth; you gonna' get a bullet.You move a little sudden, a little strange; you gonna' get a bullet.Not a warning, not a question; a bullet.You got that?- Let me hear you say, "I got it".- "I got it".- "I got it" - "I got it".- We have it.Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.Come on.Take this gun out of my holster.Point it at them.Like I said, anybody does anything.And I mean, anything.Kill 'em.So.you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth 'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?I don't know 'bout all that.But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy.'cos you almost drunk it your own damn self.But one of 'em is.Gimme the key.Gimme the key!You motherfucking black bastard!You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!What I say 'bout talkin?'Meant it, didn't I?And you need to understand, you just killed the only man here, comitted to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.Now, one of y'all.is workin' with her.Or two of y'all is workin' with her.Or all y'all is.but only one of you poisoned the coffy.So what charms this bitch got, take a man brave a blizzard, kill in cold blood, I'm sure I don't know.But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman, so you kill him.okay- maybe.But O.B.wasn't hangin' nobody.He damn sure would.But he sure enough led over there dead now, though, ain't he?He damn sure is you sons of bitches.Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy.Like me god damnit.Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall don't practice in poison need to think about that.Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor.And about the men standin' next ta' ya' would be responsible.And I know who I got my money on.Yeah that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.Not so fast Chris.We'll get there.Let's slow it down.Let's slow it way down.Who made the coffy?He did.- Yeah, he did, didn't he?- Yeah, he did, didn't he?But it's the stew that's got me thinking.How long you say Minnie been gone?A week?Si.See, my mama used to make stew.And it always tasted the same, no matter the meat.And there was another fellow on the plantation, Uncle Charly.He made stew too and like my mama's.I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper, to I was a full grown man.And no matter the meat, it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six months, so I ain't no expert, but that, damn sure is Minnie's stew.So if Minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week, how'd she make the stew this morning?And this?This.is Sweet Dave's chair.When I sat in it earlier, I couldn't belive it.Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.This may be Minnie's place, but this is damn sure, Sweet Dave's chair.And if.he went to the north side.I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him.What's in the chair?Just what I thought.Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.So.are you actually accusing me of murder?The way I see it, Senior Bob, whoever's workin' with her, ain't who they say they is.And if it's you, that means Minnie and her man ain't at her mama's.They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere.Or if it's you Britisch Man, the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere.And you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers.Or we go by my theory, which is the ugliest guy did it.Which makes it you, Joe Gage.So I take it you've deduced the coffy was poisoned while you were murdering the old man?Yes.Well, mi negro amigo, during that whole incident.I was sitting on that side of the room.Playing Silent Night on the piano.I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.I said you didn't make the stew.My theory is.you're working with man who poisoned the coffy.And both of y'all murdered Minnie, and Sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck day to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this morning.And at some point, y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us.That's as far as I got.How am I doin'?Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?So, do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory?Or can you prove it, cabrone?It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.And it's a little bit more then my theory.How long you say you been working for Minnie's?Four months.If you would have been here two and half years ago you'd know about the sign usta' hang above the bar.- Minnie mentioned that to you?- No.You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?"No dogs or Mexicans allowed" Minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this Habadashery.And it hung over that Bar every day till she took down, a little over two years ago.You know why she took it down?She started lettin' in dogs.Now Minnie likes just about everybody, but she sure don't like Mexicans.So when you tell me, Minnie went to North side to visit her mama?Well I find that highly unlikely.but okay - maybe.But when you tell me Minnie Mink took The Habadashery, the most precious thing to her in the whole world, and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like Minnie".Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.And if you lyin, which you are, then you killed Minnie - and Sweet Dave.Four measly bulltes and there goes Senior, Bob.That still don't get us no closer.to which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though.- Does it Chris?- No it sure don't.Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy, to free Daisy.If I don't hear a confession from one of you motherfuckers quick, fast and in a hurry, I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy, down that bitches goddamn throat.Okay, time's up.Stop!Alright I did it, it was me I poisoned the coffy.I fuckin' knew it!You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.You killed O.B.he's worth ten of you!Warren can I kill him?Say adios to your Huevos.Major Warren?I ain't got no gun, sheriff.Chapter Five The Four Passengers Earlier That Morning.- Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy- - How many ya' got?- Full house today, friend.We got on in there waiting.Well he's gonna' hafta keep on waitin' cause we ain't got no room.Well you need to tell Minnie.Cause he's been here two days and Minnie wants him outta here.Well I can't give him a seat I don't have - Listen why don't you take the passengers inside, introduce them to Minnie.- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.- Okay.Here we are everybody, Minnie's Haberdashery.Step outside you and your friends can stretch your legs.When you're reday, stop on inside, get warm by the fire, get some coffy in you.I'll introduve you to Minnie.Hi Minnie!I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business.But I would think coffy would be the first thing you'd make.- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.- Hats!Everybody, this is Minnie, and this is her place.Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.Lovley smile, that Gemma.Now the fella' in the uniform I don't know but the one he's playing chess with is Sweet Dave.- Hi ya' Dave.- Hey Judy.And Minnie, these are the passengers.Well that's not good enough.Go take away them rags, let's see some faces let's hear some names.Oswaldo Mobray, madame.Joe Gage.Bob.And I'm Jody.It's a pleasant surprise to find such a warm sanctuary in the middle of such a cold hell.Well make yourself comfortable.Get warm by the fire.We're just gonna' go warm ourself's by the stove, if that's all right?Stove, fireplace, whatever.Just get warm.Oh, and Judy said something about the best coffy in the world?Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world.Well I don't know 'bout all that.But I'll tell ya what it is.It's hot and it's strong and it's good.And in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up.You don't need to sell it, Minnie, you need make it.And you need to get your ass out there and help Charly with them bags and get Ed in here.- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.- I'll fix you!I don't know some old man.Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it.I'm just tellin' you what she said.Anyway she sent me out here to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.Got 'em, Ed.Miss Minnie?Would you roll me a cigarette?Sure honey, I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?It's my favorite.Don't mind me gentlemen, I'm just watching.You play?You know, I must of had at least twelve people, teach me that goddamn game.Just never could keep the moves in my head.But if I'm not disturbing, I like to watch?Hell no.I like whippin' this old man's ass in front of a audience, You ain't whippin' shit.Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.- Oh that's real nice, what is that?- It's french.- You speak french?- Oui- - Oui - what is that mean?- It means yes.Oui - Yes.- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.- What?- Ask me if my ass is fat?- It is.- I said ask me!- Why?- Just do it!- Is your ass fat?Oui, look at that y'all I can speak French.Are you the jelly bean salesman around here?How many peppermint sticks I get for a nickel?Five.All right.- Here.- Thank you sugar.Okay.Allow me to assist you, madame.I brought in your bags in case anybody wants to change your clothes before Red Rock.Peppermint stick?Thanks.So why do they call you Six Horse Judy anyway?Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team?Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.- Could you holding this for me?- Rock steady, madame.Rock steady.You gotta' very sweet accent, where that from, England?- I take exception to that!- New Zeeland.- Carefull, madame.- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?Auckland, what the fuck is an Auckland?It's where I'm from, it's our biggest city.- Coffy's ready!- It's about damn time.- Best coffy on the mountain.- I'll don't know 'bout all that.Stagecoach drivers like it.Passengers, not so much.Most find it a mite too strong.Can't be too strong on this mountain, thank you.Well, what'd ya' think?Shit!He adds something, not much, but something.What do you think, Pete?Well I must admit, he does make the set up more convincing.Do we collect the bodies and chuck 'em in the well out there?And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.Well hang on, by puttin the horses away that's easy enough.To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.Look I just started working here.Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.I had nothing to do with it.Well old man, if you was a cat what just happened here would count as one of your nine lives.You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers?- Yes.And when it comes to that pile of niggers we building out back, won't take nothin' to make you General of it.You believe that?- I expect no less.- Not so fast old man.You might have a way out of this yet.Later today, dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.And he's gonna have my sister with him, and he's gonna have her in chains.He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.- You know why?- No.Ten thousand dollars.That's why.And when he get's here.I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose.Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?- No.- You don't.- No I don't.- You sure you don't.I mean we did just kill Minnie and Sweet Dave.You and Sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here.I just met these people.I don't give a damn about them, or you, or your sister, or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter.That is a good answer, old man.So when they get here, you just sit your ass in this chair.And you don't do nothin'.You don't say nothin'.Hello, thank you, good night, that's about it.Maybe your name, but that's it.Hello, thank you, good night and.- Maybe your name.- Maybe my name.Be an old man, be dotty.Go to sleep.And don't you say nothin' and I mean nothin' to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.- Do you understand?- Yes.When it's safe I kill him, free my sister and leave you be.Deal?Deal, thank you.During the next four hours, Jody and the boys chuck the bodies down the well.Put away the horses.Tidied around Minnie's.Stash weapons for further use.And waited for John Ruth and Daisy's Stage to arrive.Here they come.Okay boys, this is it, get ready!Let's get ready.Now remember, it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory, we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly.Now killin' that fella' 'fore he kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do.So the name of the game here is patience.Trapped here for two or three days, at some point, he will close his eyes and that's when you blow the top of his head off.Remember old man, my sister don't make it off this mountain alive, neither do you.I'll do my best.Good luck, mate.What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight?I can see you already got another one up in here.I just got through putting the horses away.This ain't the normal line.But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard, so it looks like you're stuck with us.I can do another one.And Sweet Dave inside?They ain't here.I'm running the place while they're gone.Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?He says they ain't here.He's lookin' after the place while they gone.- Who are you?- I'm Bob.Well whoever you are, help O.B.with the horses.Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em.I just put those other horses away.You need it done fast, you need to help.I got two of my best men on it.You heard him freeloaders, get to work.Come on let's go!- Open up!- You have to kick it open!- What?Kick it open!Last Chapter Black Man, White Hell How you doin' old boy?They shot my nuts off they're freezin' burining up the same time, bleedin like a stuck pig.I think I'm gonna die.And these motherfuckers did it.That's how I'm doin'.How you doin'?Well my leg hurts really bad.But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot- I'm just bein' sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg.Just make yourself comfortable.Don't worry about my comfort.Shit!I can't feel my ass no more.Worry about these owl hoots and that bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.All right!You!Fella' in the basement!You either give up by the time I count to three, or I shoot Domergue in the head.One!.Two!.No, no, no, no!Don't shoot her!I'm comin' up!Hold on there you bushwhacker sack shooter, you just open the door we tell you to come up!Now throw out your pistol!Throw it to the bed.Well

doin' he was giving up?It took him too long so I done for him.Joe Gage get your ass over and shut this trap door.I'm sorry, honey.May I sit in the chair?Yes you may.Keep your hands flat on that table.And don't move 'em.Mannix!You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover.Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger?You're about to be murdered in some nigger named Minnie's house and you don't even know why!Okay, bitch.I'll bite.why?I am workin with all three of them fella's.but not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me.But because we're all gang members, The Jody Domergue Gang!That fella' y'all just killed in the basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!Well who the hell, is Jody Domergue?You wanna tell 'em bounty man?He's a big bad cat.He's worth fifty thousand dollars.And every member of his gang is wort at least ten.Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes out nigger, so is my brother's fifteen men comin' straight here for us!Tell 'em Grouch!Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in Red Rock.If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here.Their job was to sack the town, kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.Now with brohter deadd, I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?Oh yeah.And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't done anything yet, we can't forgive.So.- let's make a deal?- No deals, bitch!You gonna' let that nigger speak for you, Chris?Hold it Warren.Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell, I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch, humor me.All right, bitch.What's.your.deal?Easy.Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days.When the snow melts.we go back to Mexico and you go on to Red Rock to get that star pinned on your chest.Well.we can give 'em Marco.Bob's real name is "Marco The Mexican".He's worth twelve thousand dollars.- That's "Marco The Mexican"?- Precisely, yeah.Sheeit, after I blew his face off, Marco ain't worth a peso.If I die in the next two days, which is more than likely, you can have me.Under the name "English Pete Hicox" I've gotta' federal bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head.- And it's all your Chris.- You keep talkin', Pete.You gonna talk yourself to death.Joe Gage, who you be?- Grouch Douglass.- You heard of him?Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.He's worth ten, just like Daisy.Remind me, why we wouldn't just kill all y'all and cash in?Oh, you can kill us all.But you'll never spend a cent of that bounty money and you'll never leave this mountain alive.Because when that snow melts, the rest of Jody's gang - all fifteen of 'em - that were waiting, in Red Rock are comin' here.Now let, let's say you shoot us all.If you really want all that Domergue Gang bounty money, you still got to get all our corpses into Red Rock.And that ain't gonna' be so easy.Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team.And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team.So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into Red Rock And with that deep snow after a blizzard, you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse.So that's you, leading a string of four horses into Red Rock, and with all them horses, in that snow, and you all by your lonesome, you're gonna be a mite poky.And you gonna' run smack dab into The Domergue Gang and agin Grouch, how many is that?- Fifteen killer strong.- And when those fifteen killers, come across you, in possession of all of our dead bodies, they ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger.There gonna go back to Red Rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town.You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?You wanna save the town?Then shoot that nigger dead!You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?The deal still stands, Chris.You ain't done we can't forgive.It's still all on that nigger.Shoot 'em dead, take my body and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou- Mannix!Give me my pistol!Catch 'em here.Catch 'em here.So.you were sayin'.we sit here.all nice and friendly like.for the next two days.then the snow melts, you leave here, meet up with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?Yeah.And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?Yeah.But Jody's worth fifty thousand, what 'bout his body?You gonna make a deal with this diabolical bitch?I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal with her, we're just talkin'.Calm down.So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand?You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.We take Jody's body back with us he got children.So I kill, Warren.and we're all friends?Yeah.No deal, tramp.Chris you're makin' the biggest mistake of your life!When our boys get here in a coupla' days, their gonna cut your nuts off!And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt.Well I guess I should be plum scared right now, huh?If you had any brains, you would be.You see.here's the problem Daisy.In order for me to be scared of your threats, I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.And boy, oh boy.I sure don't.What I belive is.Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass whatever the fuck his name was.poisoned the coffy.and you watched him do it.And you watched me pork up and didn't say shit.and I believe.you all what you've always been.a lyin' bitch, who will do anything.to cheat that rope waitin' for her in Red Rock.Including shittin' out fifteen extra gang members, Whenever you needs be.And.I believe when it comes to what's left of The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang.I'm lookin' at 'em, right here right, right now.Dead on this on this motherfuckin' floor.Goddamn right.You're gonna' die on this mountain, Chris.- My brother leds an army of men- - Horse Shit!My daddy led an army, he led a renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!My daddy held up to four hundred men together after the war with nothing but their respect in his command.Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers.I don't feel so good.Oh, shit.You still alive, white boy?Mannix?Fuck!Hey, boy!Get up!Chris Mannix!Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!Wake the fuck up!Wake up, white boy!I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.Chris Mannix, I may have misjudged you.Now we've come to the part of the story.- where I blow your goddamn head off!- No, no, no don't shoot her!Why the hell not?John Ruth.John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.What's the las thing.that bastard did, 'fore he died?Was save your life.We gonna' die, white boy.We ain't got no say in that.But there's one thing left we do have a say in.And that how we kill this bitich.And I say, shootin's to good for her.John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere, anytime along the way, but John Ruth was The Hangman.and when The Hangman catches ya', you don't die by no bullet.When the The Hangman catches ya'.you hang."You only need to hang Mean Bastards." "But Mean Bastards, you need to hang".As my first and final act as the Sheriff of Red Rock, I sentence you, Domergue, to hang by the neck until dead.Hang on, Daisy.I wanna watch.Now that, was a nice dance.That sure was pretty.Hey.can I see that Lincoln Letter?Dear Marquis.I hope this letter finds you.in good health and stat.I'm doing fine.altough I whish there were more hours in the day.is just so much to do.time's changing slowly.but surely.and it's men like you that will make a difference.your military success was a credit.not only to you.but your race aswell.I'm very proud everytime I hear new of you.we still have a long way to go, but hand in hand.I know we'll get there.I just want to let you know, you're in my thoughts.hopefully our paths will cross in the future.until then.I remain your friend.ole' Mary Todd's calling.so I guess it must be time for bed.respectfully.Abraham Lincoln.Ole' Mary Todd.That's a nice touch.Yeah.Thanks.
