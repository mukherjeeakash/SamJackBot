It's too risky.You always say that.I'm through, never again, too dangerous.I'm always right too.The days of me forgetting are over.You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?You sound like a duck.Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.After tonight?I got all tonight to quack.Oh, yes!You're welcome.Takin' more of a risk.Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.Why should they give a fuck?Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.The bloke on the other end says, We got this guy's little girl.Did it work?That's what I'm talkin' about.Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.They don't lift a fuckin' finger.There probably never was a little girl.The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.-No more liquor stores?Yeah, no more liquor stores.There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.You tell'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.I don't want to either.And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.Forget it.Well, what then, day jobs?What then?This place.This place?What's wrong with that?Why not?Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.Not as expectin' anyway.Correct.Manager.They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.Fuckin' forget it.Busboys.50 an hour.Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?Yeah.Now, that was a good idea.Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.A lot of people come to restaurants.Pretty smart, huh?I'm ready.Right now, right here.All right.You're crowd control.I love you, Pumpkin.Everybody be cool!Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.LoS PiRaTaS 2002 by Terrok Jungle boogie Get down with the boogie Jungle boogie Get it on Jungle boogie Get down with

about the hash bars.Hash is legal there, right?You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.Those are hash bars?It breaks down like this.It's legal to own it.It's illegal

invention they show shows, right?The way they pick TV shows is they make one show.Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows.Some get chosen and become television programs.She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.Half-black, half-Samoan.Yeah, maybe.I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.What's a nigger gonna do?I think I know who you mean.Marsellus fucked him up good.So what he'd do?No, no, no, no, no.Well, then what then?A foot massage?Then what'd Marsellus do?They took him out on his patio.Nigger fell four stories.Nigger fell through that.That's a damn shame.What do you mean?You don't think he overreacted?It was a foot massage.I give my mother a foot massage.I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?Whoa, stop right there.and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.It's the same ballpark.Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.Have you ever given a foot massage?I'm the foot fuckin' master.Shit, yeah!I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.Fuck you.Fuck you.I could use a foot massage.You best back off.This is the door.What time you got?Come on.Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right.Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.I'm sayin' it does.We act like they don't, but they do.There's a sensuous thing goin' on.Fuckin' Marsellus knew it.That's his fuckin' wife, man.You know what I'm sayin'?Come on.What's her name again?Mia.He's goin' out of town, Florida.Take care of her?Just take her out.Make sure she don't get lonely.It is not a date.It's just good company, that's all.It's definitely not a date.How you

havin'?Hamburgers!What kind of hamburgers?No, no, no.McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.That's that Hawaiian burger joint.I ain't never had one myself.They're.You mind if I try one of yours?Yeah.Vincent!Want a bite?I ain't hungry.Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian, which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?Tell 'em, Vincent.A Royale with Cheese.Uh, because of the metric system?You're a smart motherfucker.The metric system.Sprite.Good.Go right ahead.You.You know why we're here?It's

motherfucker!H-H-He's black.He's bald!What?like a bitch?Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch?Yes, you did.You tried to fuck him.But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs.You read the Bible, Brett?Well, there's this passage I got memorized.Ezekiel 25:17.is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish.Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper.And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers!when I lay My vengeance upon thee!when all this shit is over and done.The thing is, Butch, right now.But painful as it may be, ability.And your days are just about over.But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.it does.it don't.Two?You came close, but you never made it.You my nigger?The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.Fuck pride!It never helps.'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean, you gonna say to yourself, Marsellus Wallace was right.Wallace.Say it.Yo, Vincent Vega.Jules

forget So.Sure did.Just over three years.No kiddin'?Why would you?That was my 15 minutes.It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.Fox Force Five.Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.French fox's speciality was sex.Knives.According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.where every show I would've told another joke.Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.It's corny.Tell me.You'd be embarr.I promise I won't laugh.That's not what I meant.Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.Martin and Lewis.You think I could have a sip of that?I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.I don't have cooties.Cooties I can handle.Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake!-I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin'

just met each other.I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.and think of something to say.Okay.Goddamn!I need some hair spray.We're lucky we got anything at all.Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.There's two Monroes.That is Marilyn Monroe.I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.Yeah.So did you think of somethin' to say?However.I don't want to offend you.This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.I do.No, no.I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.That's an impossibility.Is that a fact?All right, all right.What did you think about what happened to Antwan?Tony Rocky Horror.He fell out of a window.Hmm.Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.No.It's just what I heard.Who told you?They talk a lot, don't they?They certainly do.What else did they say?I'm not shy.Did it involve the F word?They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.And.That's it.threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage?Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it.Really?except Marsellus and Tony.Ladies and gentlemen.The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.Right here!I wanna dance.No, no, no, no, no.Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.All right.So dance good.You asked for it.Now let's meet our first

motion.I gotta stab her three times?But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.Okay.Kinda curious about that myself.Am I gonna kill her?It's.All right.One.Three!Something.Ohh.Mia.What's.on.What's yours?If Marsellus knew about this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you.I can keep a secret if you can.Mum's the word?Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.Okay.Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato.Goes back and squishes him and says, Ketchup.See you around.He funny, silly dog.He arctic tenderfoot!Butch?Butch, stop watching TV for a second.You've got a special visitor.Stand up.O.camp?He was in the P.W.Hello, little man.See, I was a good friend of your dad's.over five years.you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were.If it'd been me who'd.But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.I got something for ya.was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge.This was your great-grandfather's war watch, and he wore it every day he was in that war, and.until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country.This time they called it World War ll.Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.He knew it.a man he'd never met before in his life.Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.This watch.He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.his ass.Then he died of dysentery.I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.after seven years, I was sent home to my family and.Iittle man, I give the watch to you.In the heavyweight division, in the right corner wearing the blue trunks, weighing 210 pounds, Floyd Ray Wilson!It's official.Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest, hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.Do you feel this tragedy.A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.B.remain.Marsellus.I didn't do it.How you doing?I never thanked you for dinner.He booked.Says he don't know nothin'.I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.We wanna know.We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.How do you want it done?If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice.I will take care of it.Hey, mister.You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.Whatever gave you that idea?You're him.Tell me you're him.You killed the other boxing man.The radio said he was dead.What does it feel like?Killing a man.What are you, a weirdo?It is a subject I have much interest in.So?I'll tell you what.So, Esmeralda.Is that Mexican?That's some handle you got there, honey.And what is your name?Butch.I'm an American, honey.So, moving right along, Esmeralda, what is it you want to know?I couldn't tell ya.Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it?What the fuck'd I tell ya?As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.I know.Hey, fuck him, Scotty.If he never laced up his gloves, which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.It's over now.Floyd.Butch.All eight?So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?A few stragglers aside.That is great news, man.Mm-hmm.It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.You're right.All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.$45.And, uh, here's a little something for the effort.The truth.Bonsoir, Esmeralda Villa Lobos.Whew.Is that better, Sugar Pop?Hard day at the office?Got in a fight.Can you make spoons?I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.I like the way you stink.I was looking at myself in the mirror.I wish I had a pot.A pot.Pot bellies are sexy.Shut up, fatso.I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did Lucky Star.I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.Would you like it if I had a pot belly?Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.The rest of you is normal.but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.to accentuate it.I don't give a damn what men find attractive.is seldom the same.You'd punch me in the belly?Ohh!I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!Yeah.Yeah.Yes, I did.Did everything go as planned?Ow!I never listen to your fights.I won, all right.Sure am.We're not at the finish yet, baby.If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?Do you still want me to go with you?It's.Fabienne, I want you to be with me.Forever and ever.Very, very much.Yes?Will you kiss it?Okay.Butch.L'aventure commence.Giving me oral pleasure?Don't call me retard.My name is Fabienne!Stop it!Shut up, fuckhead!Okay, okay.I take it back.Oh, I like that.Tulip is much better than mongoloid.I called you a retard.Butch?Where are we going to go?Wherever you want.that we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever.Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.You betcha.Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.Donde esta el zapateria?Where is the shoe store?Spit, please.Excellent pronunciation.Que hora es?What time is it?Time for bed.Butch?Merde!Did you have a bad dream?A motorcycle movie.Are you watching it?It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.How should I know?No, imbecile, what was your dream about?I don't remember.Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.One more kiss, and I'll get up.Yep.Ohh!God.Almost nine in the morning.Eleven.What, Lemon Pie?with maple syrup, eggs over easy and five sausages.Wow, that looks nice.A tall glass of orange juice.After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.Any time of the day is a good time for pie.And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.It's there.Have you looked?What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?Yes.On the little kangaroo?Yeah, well, it's not here now.Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now!Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch?I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.Now think.I believe so.What the fuck does that mean?Then I did.No.Fuck!Motherfucker!Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are?It's not your fault.If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.You're not a mind reader.I.Don't be.Why does it mean that?Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, then I'll split.I thought I brought it.Here's some money.Have a nice breakfast.I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie.Maybe not that fast.Okay?Bye.Shit!I specifically reminded her.I said the words:

woman.If they’re gonna let you go.cash in the first time?Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils.But you don’t?I hand it to someone else first.And they follow the wrong one.Thats the idea.Can you cover that?Yeah, I got the women covered.The Del Amo Mall, the food court.Its my plan.Yeah, but its my money, and I don’t need no fuckin’ partners.I’m your manager.and I’m managing to do it all under the nose of the cops.No, a manager gets ten percent.I’m gonna give you ten.No.I’m getting %, all right?And the same deal as before.So he says, „Fuck that,“ and moves over into guns.He’s

doing.And your point is?and then just take it from them.Oh, man.No.You know what?but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden.So I thought, let him kick it here with Mel.She didn’t have to say shit.That bitch is gonna be fucking you two minutes after I’m out the door.I mean, she ain’t no damn good at it, but she likes to fuck.Is that what you thought?I didn’t know.Well.Oh.Afterwards, I did.But,

understand why you keep someone around your business and you can’t even trust ‘em.I know her.Well, you can’t trust Melanie.Well, I don’t understand why you keep her the fuck around.She’s my fine little surfer girl.and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to.You have one message sent at : p.Hi, Jackie.I was just calling to find out how everything went today at A.F.- .- .I don’t know

wrong with that.I know the type.He’s more interested in Ordell than he is in the money.but he wouldn’t walk off with the money, its evidence.What?No, I mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.You know where it came from.It wouldn’t even be missed.You’re avoiding the question, Max.especially now since I’m getting out of the bail bond business.A lot of reasons.I’m tired of it.Its been a long time coming.I guess it was.Miss Brown?I’m Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.Yeah.I hear he’s staying at a house, and, uh.Wait a minute.Yeah.So, wha?Sheronda.s a nice name.You can eat.All right.I'll

I would put back on my uniform.Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $ and go home.Because I couldn't.Melanie burst in.And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it.She didn't give me a bag.Ordell probably told her to do it.s why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.And I had to put on this suit because I could put it on faster than my uniform.I had to.What was I supposed to do?I went lookin' for you.where you were before, but you weren't there.You didn't tell me how to do that.There was nobody in the fitting room.You've no idea what happened to the $

wha?We pick up Ordell.What about me?You think I took some of that money?You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit with marked bills.You've been helpin' us out.You gave us Louis.That goes a long way in backing up your story.But if there's anything else.s between you and Ordell.You better hope we find him before he finds you.I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till I get my motherfuckin' money.If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.I'm seein' who my friends are, motherfucker, right.Hello?Do you believe that shit?See, you bring a motherfucker up.Motherfuck!.How you live like this?Like this.Bail bonds.He ain't here right now, man.Out of town?Well, give me his home number..Break out the beeper number, nigger.I've been looking for you.This is Mr Robbie, isn't it?Tha?The bond collateral that you put down on Beaumont Livingston.Oh, she got off, did she?Tell me where you are.You still there?I know you helped her.And Jackie can tell me any story comes into her pretty little head.Now, she wanna be my friend, she do that.well, you just tell her to think about old Beaumont.you tell her I will name her ass as my accessory.And tha?Do you understand what I'm sayin'?You're right.If you have time, do you think you could find out where he's stayin' for me?They don't have your winning personality.I don't have to know what I'm doing, just as long as you know.Good enough?Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on the door like the goddamned police?I thought you might be asleep.Forever.Get your ass in the house.What you doin'?Your bond refund?I have a receipt for you to sign.You know what I mean.She wants to give you your money.How'd you find me, anyway?How'd he find me?s what he does.Oh, well, bully for that nigger.Yeah.She also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.Turn around.Why don't you tell me why?She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her.What she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.All I did was walk out with it.In a way, yes.Go over there and sit on that couch.She don't even know you're here.Place stinks.Where my money at?Where Jackie at?If she want to talk to me, how come she wasn't home?Oh, right.She still is.Tell her to bring the money over here.s in the safe, she can't.Look, I'm tellin' you, you got her spooked.Oh, you expect me to just go walkin' in there?When you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.Mmm.s why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?See, I ain't trust Melanie either, but I could handle her.And I told that fuckin' Louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth.Jackie's at your office, huh?She by herself?She's all alone.I call over there, she better answer the phone.I'll be here.Goddamn.I ain't never heard her scared like that.Hold up, home.I'll drive.They're pretty good.But this time I'm really leavin' you, girl.Hope you know it, baby.Didn't I blow your mind this time.Didn't I blow your mind this time.My money's

Red Rock?- What?- Horseshit.- Where is your star?Once I get there they swear me in, but that ain't happened yet.You got anything that can back any of this up?When we get to Red Rock.And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?One alive.- Daisy Domergue.Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except me and the hangman.Well I'll be double dogged damned.- It's John.your're the nigger with the head.My lord, is that really the real head of Major Marquis, lookin' at me now?What's goin' on, y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic?Yeah.the man is red Rock suppose to pay you is

eight thousand, you help me protect my ten, deal?Y'all wanna' lie on the ground and make snow angels together?When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and Major Marquis there dinner and booze.- I don't drink, with rebel renegades, and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.Ruth, you sound like you got a axe to grind against The Cause.A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.And this should interest you Warren, imparticular emancipated blacks.Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta' newspapers printed in Washington D.Anywho, I'm just tryin' to let y'all know grateful I am.You wanna' show me how grateful you are.God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.Does he know how famous you once was?Black eye.Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the Confederacy put on the head of Major Marquis?Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.None of them found fortune.Now it didn't stay 30 thousand the length of the war.But, I bet even when it was five thousand, you had your share of country boys comin' to call?Why did they have a reward on you?After I broke out of Wellenbeck, The South took my continued existence as a personal affront.What's.You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?You bust out?Marquis did more than bust out.Marquis had a bright idea.you got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before.Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling.There was a rookie regiment spendin' the overnight in that camp.burnt to a crisp.I'm suppose to apologize for killin' Johnny Reb?I joined the war to kill White Southern Crackers And that means kill 'em anyway I can.Stab 'em.Burn 'em.Whatever it took to put White Southern Crackers in the ground that's what I joined the war to do, and that's what I did.And I made them trees, Mannix.But you had a surprise waitin' for you on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?You burnt up some of your own boys, didn't ya' Major?Wasn't the final Yankee death count somethin' like thirty-seven?So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?But if memory serves, your side didn't look at it that way.I belive they accused you of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks and the whole Blue and Grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.Isn't it Major?If he did all that, the Cavalry woulda' shot him.But they sure did think it out loud, didn't they Major?Are you killed yourself your share of redskins in your day, didn't ya' Black Major?I'll tell a' what The Cavalry didn't look kindly on.And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy would talk about anybody else's behavior during war time makes me wanna horse laugh.We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls.- We deserved dignity in defeat.My faire share, Black Major.You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk, you ride up top wtih O.No no no, you got me talkin' politics I didn't wanna'.I.And dream about how lucky I am.Easy.I can see you already got another one up in here.This ain't the normal line.Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?I'm running the place while they're gone.He says they ain't here.Who are you?Well whoever you are, help O.with the horses.I just put those other horses away.I got two of my best men on it.Come on let's go!- Kick it open!- Kick it open!- You gotta' nail it shut!- Hold it shut!You have to nail it shut!- Give me a hammer.You need to do two pieces of wood!- Two pieces of wood.Not just one piece of wood.- Yeah, allright.- Here.That door's a son of a gun.Good heavens, a woman out in this white hell.Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.About forty minutes ago.No he's a passenger.He said he was going to spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend.Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella' do, soak his ole socks in the pot?- He don't have that problem.Where's the well water?So, all three of you fellas' headed to Red Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?Coffybeans?Get your hand outta' there.Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.Good.So.No he's lyin' he ain't sheriff of nothin' He's a southern renegade.What the fuck I tell you about talkin', huh?You never gave your name, sir.- Are you a lawman?- You're a bounty hunter?- Do you have a warrant?May I see it?You're suppose to produce it upon request.What's your name, Buster?it certainly isn't Buster.- Oswaldo?Well.- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?- It says here, Dead or Alive?Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her sounds like hard work.No one said the job was suppose to be easy.Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman.Well I appreciate that.I'm Oswaldo Mobray, The Hangman in these parts.- So it would appear.No I can't say I have.I talk to my prisoner, that's it.I got I got.You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up?All right.Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!You go inside and get some hot coffy.Should be done soon.now matter how bad this blizzard gets, we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time.Okay?Come on, Chris.No no no, go inside, get warm.You're right, mi amigo.All right, follow me.- From here to the door.- All right.For the sake of my analogy, let's just assume that you did it.And, if.And as the hangman, I will perform the execution.However, if the relatives and the loved ones of the person you murdered were outside that door right now.Now the good part about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching.Not in your case.But other people, maybe not so much.The real difference is Me.To me, it dosen't matter what you did.It's my job.The man who pulls the lever, that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man.For justice delivered without dispassion, is always in danger of not being justice.No offense cowboy fella', just gettin' your attention.you got it.- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.My life story.- You bet I am.You just entered.- Who's askin'?John Ruth.Ain't no way I'm spendin' a coupla' nights under a roof with somebody I don't know who you they are.So.- Joe Gage.That's my name, Joe Gage.- I ain't goin' to Red Rock.- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.My mother.Listen, I'm just a cow puncher I just.I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time, I was a partner.Come home and spend time with my mother for Christmas.'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type.you know, looks can be deceiving.coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type.I mean.Now is that.John Ruth?Just steer clear of my prisoner.General.You sir, are a Hyena.I've been called worse.Sorry to bother you.- Kick it open.It dosen't have latch you gonna' hammer up a board.- The hammer and nails is by the door.Oh god, - Holdin' this Chris.You need to nail it in!You gotta' hammer another one.It's gonna' blow right open.- It's gotta' open if you don't.- I got it!Jesis Christ, that door's a whore!How's the coffy?Thank

hang Lance Lawson?- Do you have the execution orders on you?- May I see 'em?Who's Lance Lawson?He's the fella - who shot the fella' - who was sheriff 'fore me.What did she mean when she said, bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable?But all that just to guard her?that's the idea now.- Yeah.Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?The letter from Abraham Lincoln?- Weren't you pen pals?I'm sorry, I heard somebody in your party had a letter from Abraham Lincoln, I assumed it was you.The black fella' in the stable.Yeah.Say your name was again?- Warren.Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain.- Yeah.- Yes, they're visiting her mother.- Yes.Everybody's got a mother.- And she left you in charge?That sure don't sound like Minnie.Not yet, I ain't.Well first of, Minnie never struck me as the sentimental type.Along takin' trips to the north side.Yeah it do sound a whole lot like, don't it?Minnie still serve food?- Yes.She still stinkin' up the place with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?She rolls her own.Yeah I do, Senor Bob.- Fill me up, O.- Yeah.Thank

you.Me and my boys did our part.Hell yeah, we did.- I never knew your father, son.Thank you for saying that, General.Can I get ya' some coffy?- Well, how about a blanked?Hell, you know what, you can have mine.So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?My boy.My son, Chester Charles Smithers, he died out here a few years back.No forgiveness needed, son.It was after he served his service.Never to be heard from again.I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone.No chance he could be livin' "the cold life" out in the woods?If he had done what he came here to do, he'd a come home.You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut!Who's the idiot who broke the damn door?Okay.We need two pieces of wood.There you go, motherfucker!- Huh?Which, If I remember it correctly, that was one of them Bar of Iron rules, kinda rule, she'd want kept up in her absence.I'm guilty.How about we forget about the hats today, considering there's a blizzard going on and all, and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?Labrador.Always said that Davis was a courages man.Yes, Sir.I said the army of North Virginia would have been used in very different way.O.?I don't know that nigger.And that's all I need to know.- That nigger is- - General Sanford Smithers?Inform the nigger in the Cavalry officers uniform that I had a division of Confederates under my commend, in Baton Rouge.I heard 'em hillbilly.On the other side.General Smithers, he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.You captured a whole Colored Command that day.We had neither the time or the food.- So we shot 'em where they stood.But I strongly suggest we don't restage The Battle of Baton Rouge, during a blizzard in Minnie's Haberdashery.And if you shoot this un-armed old man I guarantee I will hang you by the neck until you are dead.I damn will guarantee that too.You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's a accident, but ya' can't just shoot 'em.We divide Minnie's in half.With the dinner table operating as a neutral territory.Georgia While the bar, represents.As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.I help you protect your eight thousand, you help me protect my ten?What is he?One of them, maybe even two of 'em, is here to see Domergue goes free.And they got 'em coupla' days.And that's when they strike, huh bitch?Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait.If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.And that's when Mr.And what do you got to say about all this?About John Ruth's ravings?Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots.That's when we gonna' kill y'all.This here is Daisy Domergue.Ten thousand dollars.Don't wanna' share it.When the sun comes out, I'm taking this woman into Red Rock, to hang.is there anybody here.from doing that?Nobody gotta' problem with this?However, I hope you all understand, I can't just take your word.precautions.why do I feel you mean me?- You are?- Nothing personal.The Hangman got himself a gun too?I feel kinda' naked without it.I'll protect you.That's right, Joe Gage.- You want it?Take your hand away from your gun.- Did he blink?Blink if your gonna' remain calm?- Take his pistol.Like I said, nothing personal.Pretty sneaky.Mobray.Hand me that little bucket.B.Go to the outhouse.Why do I gotta' go outside?And I sorta kinda trust you.Okay.Don't get any ideas, I ain't goin' soft on ya'.So Domergue, I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke of luck as far as you're concerned?- No I sure don't.How about me what?But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before.You really only need to hang mean bastards.You goddamn son of a bitch!I ain't never going out in that shit ever, ever again!B.I'm fine.I just need to get warm.B.Stew, later.So.I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?That's right, John.- Yeah I did.- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?Thee Abraham Lincoln?Abraham Lincoln The President of the United States.- Of America?- Wrote you a letter, personally?- Personally?Warren"?Personally as in: "Dear Marquis".Yes.- No you may not.Way John tells it, - y'all hada' correspondence.Way John tells it, y'all's practically pen pals?And a pen pal's.John Ruth, you really think a nigger drummed outta' the Calvary with a yellow stripe down his back, was practically friends with The President of The United States of America?Was all that horseshit?Well I guess it's true what they say about you people.What's the matter, John Ruth?As a matter of fact, you did.But you got no idea, what it's like being a black man facin' down America.And this letter, had the desired effect of disarming white folks.You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man?Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John, a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me.- I spit on it.Warren goddamit, you leave that old man alone!Or would you deny me that too?May I join you?Damn it.Got both my legs.- I can't complain.Fever took her, started this last winter.- Betsy.Augusta.I use to raise Kentucky horses.God damnit.Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards.Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.He spoke highly of his mama too.Yeah.You did not know my boy.Didja' know my son?- No.The day he met me.By then the reward was so, five thousand and bragging rights.So the Johnny's climbed this mountain, lookin' for fortune.All they found was me.I go my way, you go yours" - that's your boy Chester talkin' - You a goddamn lie." That's what they all said.Your boy told me his whole life story.And when I knew me I had the son.- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.General Smithers, don't you listen to him, he didn't know your boy!It was cold the day I killed your boy.It was colder than that.I made him strip.Then I told him to start walkin'.- You never even knew my boy?He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!But this time he wasn't begging to go home.And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.All he wanted.Now don't judge your boy too harshly, General.You'd be surprised what a man that cold, would do for a blanket.I took my big, black, pecker outta' my pants.Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head.And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.And Chester Charles Smithers, sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could.Your boy.Him shakin', him cryin' me laughin' and him not understandin' But you understand, doncha' Sandy?Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked.That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise.So what you gonna' do old man?Ignoring how I made him.The dumbest thing your boy ever did.he was your boy.Joe Gag volunteered to take Smithers dead body outside.O.lost.Marquis Warren who is supremely confident about the legality of what just transpired, ignored them sat at a table by himself and drank brandy.Hey Ozzy, hey you got the right idea.John Ruth held the door close, waiting for Joe Gage and O.to return.Domergue, however, hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.Yeah?Let's go back a bit.Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot General Smithers in front of everybody.While Major Warren was captivating the crowd with tales of black dicks and white mouths.poisoned the coffy.And the only one to see 'em do it.That's why this chapter is called.John Ruth.Can I play that guitar over there?You come back with anything else but a guitar.Domergues death march, you got it?I got it.Yeah.- Got another verse to it?Go ahead, sing it.Music time's over!- No, no, no, no, no.When you get to hell, John.Mannix the coffy!Gimme that fucking gun!Everybody get your back sides up against that back wall over yonder.It's up to you.- Then get.Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall.Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say.You move a little sudden, a little strange; you gonna' get a bullet.You got that?- "I got it".- We have it.Come on.Point it at them.And I mean, anything.So.I don't know 'bout all that.'cos you almost drunk it your own damn self.Gimme the key.You motherfucking black bastard!What I say 'bout talkin?And you need to understand, you just killed the only man here, comitted to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.is workin' with her.Or all y'all is.So what charms this bitch got, take a man brave a blizzard, kill in cold blood, I'm sure I don't know.okay- maybe.B.He damn sure would.He damn sure is you sons of bitches.Like me god damnit.Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor.And I know who I got my money on.Not so fast Chris.Let's slow it down.Who made the coffy?- Yeah, he did, didn't he?But it's the stew that's got me thinking.A week?See, my mama used to make stew.And there was another fellow on the plantation, Uncle Charly.I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper, to I was a full grown man.Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six months, so I ain't no expert, but that, damn sure is Minnie's stew.And this?is Sweet Dave's chair.Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.And if.I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him.Just what I thought.So.The way I see it, Senior Bob, whoever's workin' with her, ain't who they say they is.They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere.And you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers.Which makes it you, Joe Gage.Yes.I was sitting on that side of the room.I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.My theory is.And both of y'all murdered Minnie, and Sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck day to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this morning.But you didn't count on the blizzard and you didn't count on the two of us.How am I doin'?So, do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory?It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.How long you say you been working for Minnie's?If you would have been here two and half years ago you'd know about the sign usta' hang above the bar.- No."No dogs or Mexicans allowed" Minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this Habadashery.You know why she took it down?Now Minnie likes just about everybody, but she sure don't like Mexicans.Well I find that highly unlikely.But when you tell me Minnie Mink took The Habadashery, the most precious thing to her in the whole world, and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.Four measly bulltes and there goes Senior, Bob.to which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though.- No it sure don't.If I don't hear a confession from one of you motherfuckers quick, fast and in a hurry, I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy, down that bitches goddamn throat.Stop!I fuckin' knew it!Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.B.Warren can I kill him?Major Warren?Chapter Five The Four Passengers Earlier That Morning.- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy- - How many ya' got?We got on in there waiting.Well you need to tell Minnie.Well I can't give him a seat I don't have - Listen why don't you take the passengers inside, introduce them to Minnie.- Okay.Step outside you and your friends can stretch your legs.I'll introduve you to Minnie.I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business.- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.Everybody, this is Minnie, and this is her place.Lovley smile,

go warm ourself's by the stove, if that's all right?Just get warm.Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world.But I'll tell ya what it is.And in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up.And you need to get your ass out there and help Charly with them bags and get Ed in here.- I'll fix you!Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it.Anyway she sent me out here to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.Miss Minnie?Sure honey, I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?Don't mind me gentlemen, I'm just watching.You know, I must of had at least twelve people, teach me that goddamn game.But if I'm not disturbing, I like to watch?I like whippin' this old man's ass in front of a audience, You ain't whippin' shit.- Oh that's real nice, what is that?- You speak french?- It means yes.- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.- Ask me if my ass is fat?- I said ask me!- Just do it!Oui, look at that y'all I can speak French.How many peppermint sticks I get for a nickel?All right.- Thank you sugar.Allow me to assist you, madame.Peppermint stick?So why do they call you Six Horse Judy anyway?Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.- Rock steady, madame.You gotta' very sweet accent, where that from, England?- New Zeeland.- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?It's where I'm from, it's our biggest city.- It's about damn time.- I'll don't know 'bout all that.Passengers, not so much.Can't be too strong on this mountain, thank you.Shit!What do you think, Pete?Do we collect the bodies and chuck 'em in the well out there?Well hang on, by puttin the horses away that's easy enough.Look I just started working here.I had nothing to do with it.You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers?And when it comes to that pile of niggers we building out back, won't take nothin' to make you General of it.- I expect no less.You might have a way out of this yet.And he's gonna have my sister with him, and he's gonna have her in chains.- You know why?Ten thousand dollars.And when he get's here.Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?- You don't.- You sure you don't.You and Sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here.I don't give a damn about them, or you, or your sister, or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter.So when they get here, you just sit your ass in this chair.You don't say nothin'.Maybe your name, but that's it.- Maybe your name.Be an old man, be dotty.And don't you say nothin' and I mean nothin' to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.- Yes.Deal?During the next four hours, Jody and the boys chuck the bodies down the well.Tidied around Minnie's.And waited for John Ruth and Daisy's Stage to arrive.Okay boys, this is it, get ready!Now remember, it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory, we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly.But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do.Trapped here for two or three days, at some point, he will close his eyes and that's when you blow the top of his head off.I'll do my best.What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight?I just got through putting the horses away.But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard, so it looks like you're stuck with us.And Sweet Dave inside?I'm running the place while they're gone.He says they ain't here.- Who are you?Well whoever you are, help O.with the horses.I just put those other horses away.I got two of my best men on it.Come on let's go!- You have to kick it open!Kick it open!They shot my nuts off they're freezin' burining up the same time, bleedin like a stuck pig.And these motherfuckers did it.How you doin'?But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot- I'm just bein' sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg.Don't worry about my comfort.I can't feel my ass no more.All right!Fella' in the basement!One!Two!No, no, no, no!I'm comin' up!Now throw out your pistol!Well he got another.I ain't got another pistol!Cause if you don't throw one up here in the next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!told ya'.with your hands where we can see 'em.How ya' doin' dummy?How you like you that?What are you doin' he was giving up?Joe Gage get your ass over and shut this trap door.May I sit in the chair?Keep your hands flat on that table.Mannix!Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger?Okay, bitch.why?but not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me.That fella' y'all just killed in the basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!You wanna tell 'em bounty man?He's worth fifty thousand dollars.Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.Tell 'em Grouch!If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here.Now with brohter deadd, I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't done anything yet, we can't forgive.- let's make a deal?You gonna' let that nigger speak for you, Chris?Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell, I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch, humor me.What's.deal?Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.When the snow melts.Well.Bob's real name is "Marco The Mexican".- That's "Marco The Mexican"?Sheeit, after I blew his face off, Marco ain't worth a peso.Under the name "English Pete Hicox" I've gotta' federal bounty of fifteen thousand dollars on my head.- You keep talkin', Pete.Joe Gage, who you be?- You heard of him?He's worth ten, just like Daisy.Oh, you can kill us all.Because when that snow melts, the rest of Jody's gang - all fifteen of 'em - that were waiting, in Red Rock are comin' here.If you really want all that Domergue Gang bounty money, you still got to get all our corpses into Red Rock.Cause I doubt you can drive a four horse team.So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into Red Rock And with that deep snow after a blizzard, you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse.And you gonna' run smack dab into The Domergue Gang and agin Grouch, how many is that?- And when those fifteen killers, come across you, in possession of all of our dead bodies, they ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger.You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?Then shoot that nigger dead!Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!The deal still stands, Chris.It's still all on that nigger.Give me my pistol!Catch 'em here.you were sayin'.all nice and friendly like.then the snow melts, you leave here, meet up with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?But Jody's worth fifty thousand, what 'bout his body?I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal with her, we're just talkin'.So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand?We take Jody's body back with us he got children.and we're all friends?No deal, tramp.When our boys get here in a coupla' days, their gonna cut your nuts off!Well I guess I should be plum scared right now, huh?You see.In order for me to be scared of your threats, I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.I sure don't.Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass whatever the fuck his name was.and you watched him do it.and I believe.a lyin' bitch, who will do anything.Including shittin' out fifteen extra gang members, Whenever you needs be.I believe when it comes to what's left of The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang.Dead on this on this motherfuckin' floor.You're gonna' die on this mountain, Chris.My daddy led an army, he led a renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers.Oh, shit.Mannix?Hey, boy!Chris Mannix!Wake the fuck up!I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.Now we've come to the part of the story.- No, no, no don't shoot her!John Ruth.What's the las thing.Was save your life.We ain't got no say in that.And that how we kill this bitich.John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere, anytime along the way, but John Ruth was The Hangman.When the The Hangman catches ya'."You only need to hang Mean Bastards.As my first and final act as the Sheriff of Red Rock, I sentence you, Domergue, to hang by the neck until dead.I wanna watch.That sure was pretty.can I see that Lincoln Letter?I hope this letter finds you.I'm doing fine.is just so much to do.but surely.your military success was a credit.but your race aswell.we still have a long way to go, but hand in hand.I just want to let you know, you're in my thoughts.until then.ole' Mary Todd's calling.respectfully.Ole' Mary Todd.Yeah.No problem.
