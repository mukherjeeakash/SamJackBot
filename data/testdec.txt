State your business, or prepare to get winged!I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.Might that be you?Well, I do.King Schultz, this is my horse, Fritz.Dentist.So what?Speak English.Please forgive me, it is a second language.Hello you poor devils!I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.What's your name?Then you're exactly the one I'm looking for.Who are they?They was overseers at Carrucan plantation.Tell me If you were to see any of these three gentlemen again, would you recognize them?Stop talk with 'em like that.Like that!Everybody calm down, I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.No sale.Oh, don't be ridiculous, o'course they're for sale.My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture, or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?Oh, very well I'm sorry to have put a bullet in your beast, but I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses.You shot Roscoe!Hey, I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.Damn legs busted!Now, if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.As I was saying, if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize them?Sold American!Speck, Mr.That iron is nasty business.Thank you.Also if I were you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.Goddammit!And since you won't be needing it anymore, I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale.You go to hell, dentist!No worries!Thank you.Now as to you poor devils So as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices.Which would be at least thirty-seven miles back the way you came.The choice is yours.Tata.You gotta be reasonable on a situation like this.Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?No.They never seen a nigger on a horse before.Two beers for two weary travelers.We won't be open for another hour.Wow wow wow wow!Get that nigger outta here.Help!Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall.Sit down, my boy.Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.Bounty Hunter.No.Prost.So like slavery, it's a flesh-for-cash business.It's like a reward.Certain people, yeah.Aah!Which brings me to you.On one hand, I despise slavery.So for the time being, I'm gonna make this slave malarkey work to my benefit.So I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.However I've had this endeavor, I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know what they look like.I know what they look like, all right.So here's my agreement.I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.And when we find them you point them out, and I kill them!Okay boys, fun's over.All right folks, calm down.The jokers will be gone soon.You ain't got nothin' better to do, than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?Now you can get the marshall.Should we wait inside?After you.I want six men, six riffles behind it.All the barrels aimed at that front door.You in the saloon!You got once chance git outta this alive!Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of addressing?This is U.Marshall Gill Tatum.I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, I am ready to step outside, with my hands raised above my head.You mean like you did our sheriff?Yes, that's exactly what I mean!Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein' somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.They're a little tense out there.Come ahead.Yes indeed we are.Go on.King Schultz, and like yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the court.Now, that's two hundred dollars, dead or alive.I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.I know this because three years ago, he was rustling cattle from the B.Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.You're encouraged to wire him.In other words marshall, you owe me two hundred dollars.After this Brittle business is behind us you'll be a free man.What's your plan after that?Django I had no idea you were a married man.Me and my wife do.Django Django, Django You got sand, Django.I got no use for niggers with sand.And the girl too.And this one you will sell him cheap.There should be some sort of a records office.What is her name?What?Broomhilda?Were her owners German?She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation, she was raised by a German mistress.She speak a little German too.Hm-hm.Alright, let me get this straight.Yep.When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an Act.Hm?But during the act, you can never break character.Yeah.And you character is that of the Valet.That's a fancy word for servant.Hm-hm!You want that I pick up my own clothes?It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.I said niggers on horses- His name is Django, he's a free man, he can ride what he pleases.Not around my niggers he can't.Allow me to unring this bell.King Schultz, this is my valet Django, and these are our horses Tony and Fritz.Bennett, I've been lead to believe that you are a gentleman, and a business man.I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.No appointment, no nuttin'?Well what if I had to say I don't like you, or your fancy pants nigger, and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn.Mr.Well com'on inside, and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.Hm-hm.Oh, absolutely!Yessir, Big Daddy?Django.Betina sugar, could you take Django there, and take him around the grounds here to show him all the pretty stuff.Oh, Mr.He cannot be treated like a slave.Understood, Schultz.Yes, sir?Django is a free man.You can't treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here.You wan' I should treat him like white folks?That's not what I said.Yes I can see that.His mama works at the lumber yard.That's the boy's name, Jerry!Yes 'em, Big Daddy.The house we just left from, is the big house.That there is the pantry.Full o'squirrels.Didn't you hear him tell ya I ain't no slave?Yes.You mean you wanna dress like that?What'cho want?Three brothers, overseers.Do you know 'em?Yes, Brittle.Sometime called Li'le Raj.They could be usin' a different name.You mean The Shaffers?Three brother?Are they here?Could you point one of 'em out to me?Old man Carrucan ain't going to appreciate this now, she- she- she work in a house, John, you could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess it up, she ain't gonna be worth no- she ain't gonna worth a damn thing.You're ready?That should be me John, I been here long enough, you know me!You know master Carrugen ain't gonna appreciate this!Looking for freedom Looking for freedom ah-aah Please, please now.Is that who you was lookin' for?Where the other two of 'em?They whippin' Little Jody?You go to that tree, and keep goin' that way.Com'on now.Let me all get you set up!Hey, gimme that of what?Okay, she ready!John Brittle!I like the way you die, boy!Ya'all wanna see somethin'?Who are they?Where's Ellis?You sure that's him?Positive?You don't know if you're positive?It means you're sure.Yes, what?I'm positive he dead.Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm.I am Dr.In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Roger Brittle, and Ellis Brittle.You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers real name was Brittle.The law wants them for murder.Freeman and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal boundaries.May I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?Satisfied?Get off my land.Load up the bodies as quickly as you can, and let's get out of here.Now unless they start shootin' first nobody shoot 'em.We're gonna whip that nigger lover to death.Damn I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.Ah hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.I just made it worse.Willard's wife.Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.How 'bout you Robert, can you see?I mean, if I don't move my head, I can see pretty good, more or less.Oh shit!Anybody bring any extra bags?I'm just asking.Oh well Shitfire!Well I can't see in this fucking thing!Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!We gotta killer nigger over that hill there.Okay, I'm confused.I think we all think the bags was a nice idea.Yeah.So how about no bags this time, but next time, we do the bags right, and then

reason they'd be German.Broomhilda is the name of a character in the most popular of all the German legends.Oh yes, there is.Every German knows that story.Well Broomhilda was a princess.Anyway, her father is really mad at her.I can't exactly remember.So he puts her on top of the mountain.It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.Does a fella arise?As a matter of fact, he does.Does Sigfried save her?He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.And he walks through hellfire because Broomhilda's worth it.I think I'm just starting to realize that.But I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.Free or not, it's just too dangerous.How do you like the bounty hunting business?What's not to like?I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?How'd you like to partner up for the winter?You work with me through the winter till the snow melts.So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself, and we'll find where they sent your wife.Why you care if I find my wife?And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.His son's with him.He'll have a loved one with him.That's better then most of them get, and a damn sight better then he deserves.Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.Read it aloud.Wanted, dead or alive.For murder and stagecoach ro robbery.Seven- Thousand.Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as fellows,

buy a horse.And you know what the farmer says, the farmer says: No.And I'm stealin' that horse.Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner, because the horse is still its property.But if we ain't gonna try to buy, then how we gonna get it?Go ahead.We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?How much do you know about mandingo fighting?Can you convincingly masquerade of someone who's an expert on mandingo fighting?Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game, and your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.Bonjour.Calvin Candy.Thank you.Ain't nothin lower than a black slaver.And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.Dr.Good to see you again.Moguy.Nonsense, it's my job.Yes, this is Django

selling is worth buying, I'm curious.I'm curious what makes you so curious?Calm down Butch.Uh, Monsieur Candie Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.You do not have anything to drink, can I get you a tasty refreshment.I'll have a beer.Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard, and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver, do no spill the rum.With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I didn't seek you out for your advice.I was under the impression when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business.We were discussing my curiosity.Sheba, you stay right there.Prost.Now according to Moguy, if I do business with you, I'm doin' business with both of y'all.Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.Not for top dollar.You see, you wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me, those was all the beat ass niggers I wanna sell, so He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.You won't sell

wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.We lose sight on why we're here.Yes, I do!You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get both of us killed, and I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.A.I'm intriguing him.I recall the man.Remember that?What you said was You said, this ain't my word In my word you got to get dirty.I'm getting

would pay top dollar for the Right Nigger.Dr.Candie.But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.Now that should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern.In other words, first thing is first.I see you two gettin' on.Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear you native tongue in four years.Two weeks in Boston, oh that's your- oh man!I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz, you might have caught yourself a little dose of Nigella.It's like a pool of black tar, once it catches your ass, you can't- Yessir, you can't.Well naturally, it is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention, not the plucked chicken.Schultz, don't be so down on yourself, you are quite a dapper European gentleman.Who?Don't who me bitch, you know who I'm talking about!At the table?You don't know him?No what?You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.What would your price be?Dr.You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger, Sure, it wasn't.Sure it was.Any day.It was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that made me even consider it.You know Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.Hurray, doctor, hurray, and a wise decision, that is!And the way you have your Mr.Tuttle to draw up a legal contract before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.Naturally..Five days ?With my Mr.And then my Mr.Moguy can hash out the finer details between themselves.Gentlemen may I propose a toast to Eskimo Joe.To the Black Hercules.The Black Hercules You was right, Doctor, that name do help pay an ass.So Hildi how you like servin' at the big table in the big house, huh?I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.It's a lot better than sizzling in that hot box, or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.Hmm oh, she like them new.Yessir.the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back, since how they don't have many niggers where he come from.Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi here, did- didja just speak German, or did ya git her clothes off?I haven't- No no

she's who they want why this whole snake oil pitch about mandingos in?But that twelve thousand?Yes it did.If it had been a snake we would have beat'em.Sonsabitches!.Oh there you are!That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some shady slaver try n' sellin' a passel of ponys, would you be a dear and go out there give them gals an eyeball.Thank you,

open kill doe who one day who been took care o'me.I spent my whole life here right here in Candyland surrounded by black faces.Why don't they kill us?Now if I was Ol'Ben, I would have cut my Daddy's

here?Doctor.Jackass.I am right?Bring out Hildi!Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!And shut your mouth!Schultz in Greenville, you yourself said, that for the Right Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount., to which you said, Twelve thousand dollars.And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda the price is twelve thousand dollars.Yes I do, doctor.And I can

insist in the opposite direction.What you think I am?I think you are a bad loser.Never the less here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done until the two parties have shook hands.If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars?Mr.You really want me to shake your hand?If you insist.Caalvin!I couldn't resist.Shit!Get that fuckin' Get that fuckin'- Damn sonofabitch, what-

bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, hence forth, till the day you die, all day, ev'ryday, you will be swingin' a sledgehammer, turning big rocks into little rocks.One word of says, they cuts out your tongue, they's good at that too, you won't believe that.They gonna work you, all day, ev'ry day, till your back give up.And that will be the story end for you, Django.Shut up, black, you ain't got nothing to say I wanna hear.D'you ain't hear?Eleven thousand five hundred, actually.Back there at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune, just sittin' there, and y'all rode right past it.I ain't sayin' that, nice thing 'bout this fortune it is.You got something to say, mate, you say it.Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?There's a seven thousand dollar wanted dead or alive bounty on him, one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices.Now all four o'them gentlemen, they're back there at Candyland, laughin' their ass off.Cause they just got away with murder.You and your mate, young rabbit and Yango get that money.These sonofabitch, they- they killed innocent people.Innocent white people!Get it here.But you're a slave!Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?I'm a bounty hunter.King Schultz.We finally found their ass laying low at Candyland.Then ev'rybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.But them four men are still back there, they're still wanted, and that eleven thousand five hundred is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.You tell us who they are and we turn you lose?Look, you give me a pistol, one o'them horses, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and I'll point 'em out to you.Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's doesn't mean that other bunch o'malarky is.Ain't that black ridin' into Candyland yesterday?Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man on horse yesterday?They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode in on a horse with a white man.He weren't no slave.Damn sure.Bunch of shootin' master got shot.The German.The nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers, but they weren't.Bounty hunters.Well, smoke you gotta deal.What is that?You're a funny bugger!Yeah, yeah.You got yourself a deal, mate.Oh yeah!For you, we'll give you that pack horse over here.Dynamite.I can understand that.A little dynamite for you black ass to play with!Yeah, alright.Now, don't drop the fucking thing, alright?Uh, that's good to know.Jake!You gotta try to see what's goin'on with that goddamn dog!Love you too, son.In the sweet byin' bye we will leave on that beautiful song.Cora, would you prepare us some coffee?Come on.Just a bit sooner than ya'all was expectin'.Now why would?Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my Django!To dear son, hey Billy.Now, all o'you black folks, I suggest you get away from all these white folks.You're right where you belong.Do- do what now?Bye miss Lara.Steve!You know for an hour, I didn't know the burgundy was my color.I count two guns, nigger.But I noticed you didn't knit your knee cap.Ev'ry single word that came out of Calvin Candy's mouth was nothin' but cold shit.I am that one nigger in ten thousand.You motherfucker!You ain't go get away with this, Django.You can run, nigger, but they gonna find your ass!They gonna just kill you, nigger!This Candyland, nigger!We been here long way, you can't beat Candyland.You up on a sonofab- Hey Little Trouble Maker.You know what they are going to call you?Let git outta here.
