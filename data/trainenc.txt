Forget it.I'm through doing that shit.The same thing every time.I know that's what I always say.You forget about it in a day or two.The days of me remembering have just begun.I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.Quack, quack, quack.Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.Correct.Can I get anyone more coffee?Thank you.I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.Banks are easier.They're insured.I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.He gives the phone to a teller.If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.Fuckin' right it worked.Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.Cleans the place out.Did they hurt the little girl?The point of the story isn't a little girl.You want to rob banks?I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.-What've we been talkin' about?Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.They make it too personal.I'm not gonna kill anybody.But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.See how far that gets you.We're out of it.Not in this life.Garon, coffee!Garon means boy.A coffee shop?Nobody ever robs restaurants.Bars, liquor stores, gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.They're not expectin' to get robbed.I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.Same as banks, these places are insured.He don't give a fuck.Waitresses.No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.Some wetback gettin' paid $1.really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.All the customers kept comin' in.You got the idea of takin' their wallets.Thank you.Yes, we did.A lot of wallets.Pretty smart.Let's do it.Come on.Same as last time, remember?I'll handle the employees.I love you, Honey Bunny.This is a robbery!and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.Okay, what you want to know?It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.Yeah.It's legal to buy it.And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.Oh, man!That's all there is to it.I know, baby.But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?It's the little differences.Example.And I don't mean just like no paper cup.And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?They got the metric system.What do they call it?Royale with Cheese.What do they call a Big Mac?Le Big Mac.I don't know.You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?Mayonnaise.I seen'em do it, man.Yuck.How many up there?That's countin' our guy?So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?We should have fuckin' shotguns.Mia.How did Marsellus and her meet?However people meet people.Oh, really?I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.What's a pilot?I don't watch TV.Yeah.That show's called a pilot.and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.Some don't, become nothin'.You remember Antwan Rockamora?Used to call him Tony Rocky Horror.Fat, right?I mean, he got a weight problem.He's Samoan.What about him?Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.Fuck her?Nothin' that bad.He gave her a foot massage.That's it?Sent a couple cats over to his place.Threw his ass over the balcony.He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.But still, you play with matches, you get burned.You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.A foot massage is nothin'.It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.Eatin' the bitch out.It's not.Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies.Foot massages don't mean shit!Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.You given a lot of them?Got my technique down and everything.Would you give a guy a foot massage?You give'em a lot?You know, I'm kind of tired.Yo, yo, yo, man.I'm gettin' a little pissed here.Yeah, it is.No, it ain't quite time yet.Let's hang back.for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a massage don't mean nothin'.Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.It's an interestin' point.Let's get into character.Mia.Why you so interested in big man's wife?And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.No, man.Show her a good time.You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.It's not a date.Hey, kids.Hey, keep chillin'.We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.Now, let me take a wild guess here.Yeah.You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?Good.Sorry about that.Hamburgers.The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.Where'd you get 'em?Where?Big Kahuna Burger!I hear they got some tasty burgers.How are they?They're good.This is yours here, right?This is a tasty burger!You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?They're real tasty.Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.But I do love the taste of a good burger.No.A Royale with Cheese.You know why they call it that?Check out the big brain on Brett!That's right.What's in this?Sprite.You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?That hit the spot.Flock of Seagulls.Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid.I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing!It's in the cupboard.We happy?We happy?Look, I'm sorry, uh, l.I got yours.Right?My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.I just want you to know how.with us and Mr.W-We got into this thing with the best intentions.I never.I didn't mean to do that.Continue.What's the matter?Oh, well, allow me to retort.What?What?They speak English in What?English, motherfucker!Yes!Yes.What?Say what again!I dare ya!Say what one more goddamn time!Go on!Does he look like a bitch?Does he look.No!I didn't.Yes, you did, Brett!No, no.Wallace.Yes!Sort of fits this occasion.The path of the righteous man.and the tyranny of evil men.and the finder of lost children.and furious anger.And you will know My name is the Lord.I think you gonna find.I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.you got ability.don't last.Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.If you mean it turns to vinegar.If you mean it gets better with age.Besides, Butch, how many fights you think you got in you anyway?Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.Certainly appears so.That's pride fuckin' with you.Pride only hurts.You fight through that shit.I got no problem with that, Mr.In the fifth, your ass goes down.In the fifth, my ass goes down.Our man in Amsterdam.Get your asses on in here.You don't even want to know.The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.You see the white boy leave, go on over.I been doin' pretty good.All right.At Marsellus's request.Not yet.Not a goddamn thing.Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed, Laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for?Gimme a pack of Red Apples.No.You ain't my friend, palooka.-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.My nigger, get your ass over here.Man, I'm really sorry.Pack of Red Apples.40.Thanks.Whoa.It's a great book on piercing.Forget that gun.All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.Excuse me.why would you wear a stud in your tongue?Helps fellatio.Step in my office.Very good stuff.Different, but equally good.Now, the first two are the same.This is 500 a gram.There's nothing wrong with these two.But this one is a fuckin' madman.Am I a nigger?No.Now, white people who know the difference.Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit.That's a bold statement.This is a seller's market.dead.All right.Okay.I just hope that I still have some left for ya, but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.I'm outta balloons.Yeah, that's cool.I'll just get one for ya.Okay.She

years.They should be fuckin' killed, man.I wish I could've caught him doin' it.It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile?You don't do it.Thank you.Mind if I shoot up here?Muchas gracias.I'm getting dressed.Come inside and make yourself a drink.Hello?Vincent.Where is.It's on the wall by the two African fellows.Warm.Disco.Push the button if you want to talk.Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.Okay.What the fuck is this place?An Elvis man should love it.Let's go

Lonesome Town To cry my troubles away Could you, um.You can have this one, cowgirl.The streets are filled with regret Think nothin' of it.Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.How long were you there?I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.I didn't know that.I heard you did a pilot.What was it?What?Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.She was the leader.The black girl was a demolition expert.What was your speciality?The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.And she knew a zillion old jokes.And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick.You know any of them old jokes?Tell me.Don't be that way.No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.You know it.What a gyp.Vanilla Coke.Be my guest.You can use my straw.Yeah, but maybe I do.All right.-Told ya.Don't you hate that?Uncomfortable silences.I don't know.That's when you know you found somebody really special.Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad.I'll tell you what.You sit here.I'll do that.I said goddamn!Goddamn.Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.Which one?No, there's not.That is Mamie Van Doren.Pretty smart.I got my moments.Actually, I did.you seem like a really nice person, and l.This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.Well, well, I do.But you have to promise not to be offended.You can't promise somethin' like that.You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended.Let's just forget it.Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission?Well, here goes.Who's Antwan?You know him.Hmm.Well, that is one way to say it.Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.Is that a fact?No, it's not a fact.That's just what I heard.They.They certainly do.Don't be shy, Vincent.I'm.Um.No, no, no, no, no.And?And nothin'.You heard Marsellus.And you believe that?Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window.No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.But did it happen?at my wedding.Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window.When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.Now the moment you've all been waiting for.Now, this is where one lucky couple.Now, who will be our first contestants?All right!No, no, no, no, no.I do

never gonna find anything in this mess!Lance, get in here!Pig.Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.Does it gotta be exact?I don't know exactly where her heart is.That's it.You got it?A magic

right, then say something.That was fuckin' trippy.Oh, man.Mia.What's your thoughts on.on how to handle this?Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life, he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.I seriously doubt that.Shake on it?Cool.Vincent.Sure.No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.I can't wait.Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.Ketchup.Oh, that Paddlefoot.He think totem pole alive!That totem pole been here forever!One more thing, and we'll start for.Yeah?Stand up.Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a P.W.Well, this here is Captain Koons.O.camp with Daddy.Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together.Hopefully.for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.Butch.This watch I got here.It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.on the day he set sail for Paris.when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed.to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.Dane was a Marine, and he was killed.Your granddad was facing death.None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive, so three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki.to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch, it'd be confiscated, taken away.He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright, so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something.Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.He give me the watch.Then.now.It's time, Butch.It's official.Wilson is dead!Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.My guess would be yes.I think any man would've left the ring that fast.is gonna affect the world of boxing?It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.A.Man, you know I didn't.No, it wasn't.I didn't do it.Great.What you got?His trainer?I believe him.No, we don't wanna think.Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.Butch's search.I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.ready to pop a cap in his ass.Mister.What?You're the fighter?No, come on.I know you're him.I'm him.He's dead?Sorry about that, Floyd.What does what feel like?Beating another man to death with your bare hands.No.You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.What does it feel like to kill a man?Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there, and I'll tell you all about it.Villa Lobos.The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.Thank you.Butch.What does it mean?Our names don't mean shit.I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.I don't feel the least bit bad about it.Huh?I know.Unbelievable.If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr.Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr.How many bookies did you lay it around on?How long to collect?No, I understand.Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.Yeah.No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.Okay, my brother.You're goddamn right.Cool, brother.60.Now, if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.Buenas Noches, Butch.Keep the light off.Oui.Pretty hard.Poor baby.You know what?I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.Let me take this jacket off.Uh-huh.You were looking at yourself in the mirror, and you wish you had some pot?A pot belly.Well, you should be happy, 'cause you have one.I don't have a pot.It's not the same thing.The difference is huge.No.But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass.If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small.You think men would find that attractive?It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye.If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.Right in the belly.I'd smother you!You'd do that?Promise?Did you get everything?Good job, Sugar Pop.You didn't listen to the.You didn't listen to the radio?Were you the winner?Are you still retiring?So it all worked out in the finish.We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?But they won't find us, will they?I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.Say it.Forever?Do you love me?Butch.Will you give me oral pleasure?But you first.Okay.Mon amour.I think I cracked a rib.No, retard, from the fight.My name is Fabby.Stop it.My name is Fabi.I hate that mongoloid voice.Sorry, sorry, sorry.Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?I like being called a tulip.I didn't call you a mongoloid.And I took it back.Yes, Lemon Pie?Well, I'm not sure yet.We're gonna get a lot of money from this, but it ain't gonna be the kind of money.I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.But I do not speak Spanish.Besides, Mexican's easy.What does that mean?Donde esta.Donde esta el zapateria?You'll be my little mamacita in no time.Que hora es?What time is it?Sweet dreams, jellybean.Never mind.You startled me.What is this you're watching?I'm not sure the name.In a way.What was it about?You were the one watching it.I don't know.It's really rare that I remember my dreams.Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.Satisfied?Get up, lazy bones!Ohh.What time is it?What time does our train arrive?You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes.Anything to drink with that?To drink.and a black cup of coffee.Pie for breakfast?Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.Where's my watch?No, it's not.Yes, I've fuckin' looked.You sure you got it?Bedside table drawer.Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.Well, it should be.So where the fuck is it?Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch?All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.Did you get it?You believe so?You either did or didn't get it.Are you sure?Fuck!Fuck!Motherfuckin'.No!You left it at the apartment.I had you bring a bunch of stuff.If all I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.Are you?I'm sorry.Just means I can't have breakfast with you.Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.I saw your watch.I'm so sorry.Go out and get those pancakes.I'll take your Honda.Blueberry pie.But pretty fast.Okay.Bye.Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget, she forgets my father's watch!bedside table, on the kangaroo.Visit

Zed?Zed's dead.You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked.Wallace.I don't wanna die.Yes!Sorta fits the occasion.The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides.and the tyranny of evil men.and the finder of lost children.and furious anger.And you will know My name is the Lord.I'm fucked.Oh, fuck.Oh, goddamn.Vincent, Marvin.Better tell him to shut up.Fuck.Marvin!Die, you motherfuckers!Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?Did you forget that someone was in there.You see the size of that gun he fired at us?We should be fuckin' dead, man.We was lucky.That shit wasn't luck.This was divine intervention.I think so.That's right.God came down from Heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.Don't do that.What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!This shit happens.Wrong.Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car.We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!All right, it was a miracle.Let's go, nigger!Shit.I was

closet.The thicker the better, the darker the better.Can't use 'em.with quilts and blankets, so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last, but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.Boys, get to work.Come again?Get it straight, buster.I'm here to tell you what to do.I'm here to help.No, Mr.Mr.I don't mean disrespect, okay?I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.Nothin' except for the mess

character.Wanna share a cab?Feel like havin' breakfast with me?I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.I know that now.Thank you.Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.No, man, I don't eat pork.I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.Pigs are filthy animals.Yeah, but bacon tastes good.Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know.Pigs sleep and root in shit.I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.Dog eats its own feces.Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?But a dog's got personality.Ah, so, by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal.We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.Oh, man, that's good.You're startin' to lighten up.I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.About the miracle we witnessed.I witnessed a freak occurrence.Act of God.When, um, God makes the impossible possible.I don't think qualifies.See, that shit don't matter.It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.Now, whether or not what we experienced.But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.But why?But I can't go back to sleep.You're really thinkin' about quittin'.Most definitely.Fuck.Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth.Like Caine in Kung Fu.And how long do you intend to walk the Earth?What if He don't do that?So you decided to be a bum.No more, no less.They got a name for that, Jules.And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.Coffee!But water into wine, l.Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.I'm gonna take a shit.When did you make this decision?Yeah.Fuck.I love you, Pumpkin.Everybody be cool!Any one of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!You just be quiet over there!Get on the fuckin'.You're in a blind spot.Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie?Get down!Fucking move!Move!Get down on the fucking floor!Down!No problem at all.No, sir, I'm not.I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.I am not a hero.Get the fuck down!Just take whatever you want.Yeah.You understand me?Listen, everybody.Get the fuck down!All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets!You just throw 'em in the bag!I said, are we fucking clear?Now, wallets out!Get the fuck down.In the fucking bag!In the bag.ln the fucking bag.Laura.In the bag.Yeah.Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.In the bag.In the bag.My boss's dirty laundry.When he wants it clean.Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.'Fraid I can't do that.Yes, you did.Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.Stop causing problems!Give'em what you got and get'em outta here!This ain't none of your goddamn business!No problem.Now, I'm gonna count to three.We clear?Two.Okay, Ringo.It's yours.Hey, what is it?Is that what I think it is?Goddamn it, what is it?You let him go!Tell that bitch to be cool.Say, Bitch, be cool!Be cool!You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!Chill out, Honey Bunny!Chill out, Honey Bunny!I promise!Chill out, Honey Bunny!Yolanda.Don't you hurt him!We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.Come on, Yolanda!He's cool.Cool.And that's what we're gonna be.Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.And when you do it, you do it cool.One, two, three.Yolanda!Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.Well, that seems to be the situation.And you don't want that.So let's see what we can do.here's the situation.But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.to just hand it over to your dumb ass.Be cool!Get back!We still just talkin'.Point the gun at me.There you go.and don't do a goddamn thing.It's still cool, Honey Bunny.I.I wanna go home.I'm proud of you.It's almost over.I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.I love you too, Honey Bunny.Which one is it?That's it.Open it up.Count it.About 1,500 dollars.It's yours.Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.Yolanda!Vince, shut the fuck up!Come on, Yolanda.Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?Your life.You read the Bible, Ringo?Well, there's this passage I got memorized.The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides.and the tyranny of evil men.And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger.And you will know I am the Lord.I been sayin' that shit for years, and if you heard it, that meant your ass.I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker.But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man, and Mr.protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd, and it's the world that's evil and selfish.But that shit ain't the truth.and I'm the tyranny of evil men.I'm tryin' real hard.Go.Yeah, that's probably a good idea.Ooh-ooh-ooh.Ooh-ooh-ooh.I was the third brother of five.I’m not saying what I did was all right.Been down so long gettin’

all right.Can we just stop at a -Eleven or something?I’d love to, but not there.Is it dark?It doesn’t sound dark.Because it looks like I just got out of jail, thats why.There’s a joint near me.I quit three years ago.Ten pounds.Thats why I don’t quit.If I can’t fly, I’m gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand.the other day I figured out that I must have written about.I figure about % of those were drug-related, so.So far, they told me if I cooperate.Or if I stand mute, I can get as much as five years.I’d say that if they try you and convict you, you won’t get more than a year and a day.But they won’t want to do that.and a year or two of probation.Yeah.They were waiting for my ass.They even knew the exact amount.Who gave me the money and who I was givin’ it to.They said it was him who told them about me.Beaumont Livingston.I wrote him on Monday.Ordell pick up his bond?$ .I left Tennessee very much alive.You’re welcome.You bet.We’ll be in touch.Had some trouble with my

Warren.We shared a steak dinner once upon a time in Chattanooga.That be me.- Since that steak?So why don't you explain to me.I'm tryin' to get a coupla' of bounty's to Red Rock.You know I am.Circumstances caused us to take the long way around.You don't know nothin' about this filly here?Don't even know your name?Well I guess that makes this one fortuitous wagon.Major Marquis Warren, this here is Daisy Domergue.Warren.She's a pepper, ain't she?They find it offensive.- Now that I can believe.- Should I?maybe you might of heard tell 'bout the price on her head.- Ten thousand dollars.Kill Lily Langtree?Now that ten thousand's practically in my pocket.Especially to professionals open for business.I ain't got no designs on her.That's damn sure good enough for me.Let me see their paperwork.Back off.I sure hate to interrupt y'all!I realize that!Okay boy, we'll give it a try.You ain't really gonna' let that nigger ridin' in here is ya'?B.They are real pretty, ain't they?You got it?Let me hear you say: "I got it.Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin' these fella's up on the roof.B.Well, I agree with O.This storm's got me concerned.Goddamit to hell, I'm already regretting this!And my wrist is gonna' stay cuffed to hers, and she ain't never gonna' leave my goddamn side, until I personally put her in the Red Rock jail!- Yeah, I got it.Translation/Timings/Creator by: Deluce So what happend to your horse?I done had him for a bit.- That's too bad.Me an' ole Lash rode a lotta' miles together.Never the less.Who's Daisy Domergue?I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope.No I do not have mixed emotions.- You bet.You know I am.You never wait to watch 'em hang?Never?We talked about this in Chattanooga.Can't catch me sleepin' if I don't close my eyes.No one said the job was suppose to be easy.But that little lady, is why they call him "The Hangman".But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya', you don't die by a bullet in the back.you hang.I'll give you he got guts.Now Daisy, I want us to work out a signal system of communication.that means: Shut up.I got it.I know we only met each other once before.But.You still got it?The Lincoln letter?Do you got it on you?Right here.I can imagine you probably don't like to take it in an'out of the envelope all that often.You right, I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much.- But."Ole Mary Todd's callin', so I guess it must be time for bed" Ole Mary Todd.That gets me too.It's a letter from Lincoln.They shared a correspondence during the war.This is just one of the letters.O.Stop!Of all the stupid, like to rip my goddamn arm off!You the one handed her my goddamn letter.That nigger like to bust my jaw.And when he do, I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh.She didn't help it none.Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?ain't no goddamn.Hey Mister Ruth?There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road!Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah.This changes things, son.But with a partner, eighteen's a whole lot better.Or her?- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.Chapter Two Son of a Gun Hand your weapons to the driver.Never mind the jokes, just do it.- I do.I done did it.B.Ya' got 'em?- Okay fella', you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand, and you keep that other hand where I can see it.I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?- You know this fella'?Like I said friend, you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.Whoever you are mister, you sure sound tough when you're talkin' to a desperate man knee deep in snow.I just wanna' ride.Who is this joker.- Mannix's Marauders?The scourge of South Carolina, Mannix Marauders.What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?Face, I was riding to Red Rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow, fucked up his leg, an' had to put 'er down.- Yes I do.I'm the new sheriff.- 'fraid not.- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.And that's when you get your star.Yeah.And from the look of those three frozen fuckers up there, I figure you're a bounty hunter open for business.Three dead.- Who's that?Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?The Hangman?- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.And you.Major Marquis.Yeah it's really me and it's really my head.Never mind, you takin' in them three dead bodies and her to Red Rock to get paid, ain't ya'?Well.The new sherrif.Well execuse me for findin' it hard to belive a town electin' you to do anything except drop dead.No I suppose not.No.- Then you'll hang.Driver!I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here.Yeah.And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains?Sorry bushwackers, I ain't entering Red Rock that way.And I expect you, O., to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock that John Ruth, let their new sheriff freeze to death.You let me die, that's murder.O.Give the Major back his iron.Now.Ain't love grand.- Tell ya' what, Bob- - The name's John.- May way of sayin' thanks.Well Mr.The cause of a renegade army?Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the Rebel Flag as an excuse to kill and steal.Sounds like my kinda' fella'.C.I was a goner, and y'all saved me.shut up!Here, last piece.I don't think so.Do you know who he is?Yeah.No they didn't.Them peckawoods left their homes and their families, and come to this snowy mountain, lookin' for me and fortune.The ones you ain't ever heard of no more, they found me.Once passions had colled, it dropped down to eight, then five.You know I did.The Confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them.So The Cause put a reward on my head.Wellenbeck?No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!Maj.Maj.So bright.Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.So I burnt it down.Forty-seven men.Southern youth, farmer's sons, - cream of the crop- - And I say, "Let 'em burn".You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.Shoot 'em.Drown 'em.Drop a big ole' rock on their head.To answer your question, John Ruth, when Major Marquis burned forty seven men alive, for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees, that's when The South put a reward on the head of Major Marquis.And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed The Northern Line.See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck, seems not all of them boys were Rebs.How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'?That's the thing about war Mannix, people die.Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with.I think they thought, thirty-seven white men for one nigger wasn't so hot a trade.And that's why they drummed your black ass outta' the Cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back.Horse shit.I didn't say they could prove it.But, Warren's war record was stellar, and that's what saved his ass.Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.Mannix's Marauders that's what.Don't you say anything about my daddy, what he fought for, was dignity in defeat, and against the unconditional surrender.We were your brothers.- Just, how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat?'Cuz when niggers are scared, that's when white folks are safe.B.Like I said y'all, I'm just happy to be alive.I think I'll just look out this winda' let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep.Chapter Three Minnie's Haberdashery Get in there.What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight?I just got through putting the horses away.But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard, so it looks like you're stuck with us.They ain't here.Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?He's lookin' after the place while they gone.I'm Bob.B.Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em.You need it done fast, you need to help.You heard him freeloaders, get to work.- Open up!- What?Shut that door, there's a goddamn blizzard out there!- You have to nail it shut!- There's a hammer and nails by the door!There's a hammer and nails by the door!- Yeah.One ain't good enough!- That fuckin' thing is busted!- Gimme that other piece of wood.- Gimme the nail.Jesus.Who's the idiot who broke that, that Mexican fella'?You must be frozen solid, poor thing.When did you fella's arrive?The Cowboy fella' in the courner, is that your driver?The driver lit out.Jesus Christ, that's awful!I think we all felt the same way, but were a little too polite to say something..Over there.Yes, all three of us were on that stagecouch out there.Over there.The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with us.If he is a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable.the new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with you?He's just talkin' his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck!John Ruth.- I'm takin' her to the law.- That's right, Buster.- 'Course I do.Why?How am I suppose to know, you're not a villain, kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession?Well.It's Oswaldo Mobray.- Yes.I got my warrant, Oswaldo.- Yeah it's her.- Yeah it does.Wouldn't transporting her be easier if she were dead?And why is her hanging proper, so important to you?He's gotta' make a living too.Allow me to properly introduce myself.- Looks like I brought you a customer.Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers?Don't talk to my prisoner.You got it?Jolly good.The Bar is open, follow moi.All right.I'll feed and water the horses.I've got some stew cooking.Now look.So me an' Chris better lay out a line from the stable to the front door, and from the front door to the shithouse.Good idea.I'll give you a hand.You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?Muchas gracias.We gonna' drop one, every ten paces.- Yeah!Now, you're wanted for murder.John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock to stand trail for murder.you're found guilty, the people of Red Rock will hang you in the town square.And if all those things end up taking place, that's what civilized society calls "justice".And after busting down that door, they drug you out in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that, we would be frontier justice.The bad part is it's apt to be Wrong as Right.In your case, you'd have it comin'.But ultimately what's the real difference between the two?The Hangman.When I hang you, I will get no satisfaction from your death.I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there.And that dispassion is the very essence of justice.Amen.Yeah, well.What'cha writing firend?- What's that?- You're writing your life story?Am I in it?Well you like writing stories so much, why don't you tell me the story that brings you here?- I am.I'm bringin' in this one to Red Rock to hang.And I don't know who you are.who are you?- What?Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?- Where you goin'?- What's there?Your mother?I got back from a long drive and.For the first time in my life I, made a pretty penny and, eh.Now that's funny.Yeah, well.Because I definitely am a.Christmas with Mother?it's a wonderful thing.good enough for you?For now.Hello old timer.General.And I have no wish to speak to you.Fair enough, General.- You gonna' kick it open.It's already cold enough in here.You gotta' nail it shut!- There is a hammer and nails right there!- Here, here.You need two pieces of wood.One ain't good enough!- Goddamn it!- Shut up!Son of a bitch!I get it, haberdashery, that was a joke.Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.Guess who he is?Hardly, no.- Oh, you are?Well good to meet you Mr.- Mobray.- Really?- Pay no attention to him.Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot by the stove is a hell of driver named O.That's the only thing you said that's the truth.Precisely.- In my beg.- Of course.He's a fell' been sittin' in the Red Rock jail about a month now.Precisely.He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable.I don't think that was the original idea, but.- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?Five of you?Yes it does.The Lincoln what?President Abraham Lincoln?- With the President?Not him!The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?- Bob.Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?- What?- They ain't here?- Her mother?I never knew Minnie had a mother.Yeah, I suppose.- Si.Are you callin' me a liar?- But it sounds peculiar, though, - What sound peculiar?Secondly, I can't imagine Sweet Dave liftin' his fat ass outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water, unless Minnie was layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar, mi negro amigo.But I still haven't done it yet.- Do you consider stew food?- Then we serve food.Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe."Red Apple Tobacco" But mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.Just seein' if you do.B.Goddamn it!Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty.You've got a good eye son.General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!- Erskine's boy?May I sit down, Sir?Genaral Sandy Smithers.oh boy.I heard you gave those Blue Bellies sweet hell.Just like Erskine and his boys did their part.- Yankees sons of bitches?But, I always respected his resolve.Your respect woulda' meant the world to him.- That would be nice.That would be even nicer.Here we go General.If ya' don't mind me askin'?You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?Forgive me sir.Like I said, it was a few years back.He came out here to the hills of Wyoming, to make his fortune.I bought him a symbolic plot in the Red Rock cemetery.Was he a goner fer' sure?It's a rough life, but folks can learn it.Close it, close it!Really?Fucking hold it low.Hold it, mi negro amigo.Ola mi cabron.- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?Considering Minnie's no hats indoors policy?You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats.I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats.A large black dog.You know my daddy, I said that my daddy!But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond.I agree with that the army in North Virginia would've been used in a.Shut up!B.Do you know that nigger, Sir?But I know he's a nigger.Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.Battle of Baton Rouge?Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to inform you.Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also.Oh that's interesting.- On the other- - Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger, that I don't acknowledge niggers in Northern uniforms.But not one Colored Trooper made it to a camp, did they?Nor the inclination to care for Northern horses, and least of all Northern niggers.- Gentlemen, Gentlemen, I know Americans aren't apt to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war.Now, my Nubian friend, while I realize passions are high, that was a while ago.Once we arrive in Red Rock.Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men.Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here, close together like for a few days, may I suggest a possible solution?The Northern side and The Southern Side.We could say that the fireplace side of the room, acts as a symbolic representative of.Philadelphia!We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon?One of them fella's is not what he says he is.He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is.And to accomplish that goal, they'll kill everbody in here.So all they gotta' do is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity.If you say so, John.Our best bet is this, duplicitous fella' ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing it's the right one, isn't so easy.He'll try and create his opportunity.Jumpy reveals himself.What do I got to say?He's absolutely right.And we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep.Okay everybody, hear this.She's wanted dead or alive for murder.That money's mine boys.I ain't gonna' lose it.Now.comitted to stopping me`.Really?Well, I guess that's very fortunate for me.Circumstances force me to, take.When you say precautions.- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.- Yes I am.- Just mine?I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours.Oh, I still got mine.A bastards work is never done, huh, John Ruth?- Now gimmie the gun.You have to come and take- Calm down.Blink if you're calm.- He blinked.- He blinked.I'm real sorry about this, son.Just a precaution.I'm afraid the same applies to you too, Mr.Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose.O.?Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole.Your jacket's already on.After you Major.I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.You lift your ass even one inch off this seat, I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat.- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?How 'bout you Oswaldo?Look, considerin' all the thing I done for money, I ain't one to judge.Till they invent a trigger a woman can't pull, if you're a hang man, you're going to hang woman.When it comes to some of them mean bastards out therem it's the only thing does the job.But mean bastards, you need to hang.I almost died out there!You okay, O.?I'll be fine.You want some stew, O.?That's nice.- how you doin', black Major?Leave me be from your horseshit.I tole' you jackass to Hee-Haw somewhere else.- You did say, didn't ya'?So.- Yes.Yes.- Yes.- Yes.- Yes.As in: "Dear Maj.- No."Dear Marquis" Abraham Lincoln the President of the United States of America?- May I see it?But the way John tells it, you weren't just some random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters.- Yes.Yes.practically a friend.John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery, had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln, Least of all, that nigger there.Course it was.You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth.I hurt your feelings?I know, I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed.Call it what you want, I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.- I might let a whore piss on it.Good for you, sister.Stand down you son of a bitch, I shared a battle field with this man.I suppose you were there.Yes you may.So, how's life since the war?Got both my arms.- Got a woman?What was her name?- Georgia girl?Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies.I made good deal on her.Set myself up pretty well.Yeah, your son came up here a few years back.You knew my boy?Yeah I knew 'em.Suit yourself.I know the day he died, - do you?You wanna know what day that was?He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'.But back then to battle hard rebs, five thousand just to cut off a niggers head, now that's good money.But there was no fortune to be found.All them fella's came up here sang a different tune, when they found themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun, "Let's just forget it."If you just let me home to my family, I'll swear, I'll never set foot in Wyoming again.Beggin' for his life.And you was in that story, General.Of The Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge.- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!He just heard, tell why you here is all!And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold.And on that cold day, with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel.Right down to his bare ass.I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him.- No he didn't!Then he commits to begging again.He knew he'd never see his home again.'Cos he knew that was long gone.was a blanket.You ain't never been cold as your boy was that day.Wanna know what your boy did?And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it.Then I stuck my big, black Johnson right down his goddamn throat.You bet your sweet ass it was warm.Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?black dudes dingus in his mouth.I never did give your boy that blanket.No blanket.Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers, that you chose not to acknowledge.You gonna' spend the next two or three days, ignore the nigger that killed your boy, Ignoring how I made him suffer?lick, all over my Johnson?was to let me know.Chapter Four Domergue's Got a Secret About fifteen minutes has passed, since we last left our characters.Straws we drawn to see who would help him.B.Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo, had vigorous debate about the legality of self-defense murder they just transpired.Captain Chris Mannix dawn the dead Generals coat and joined Oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns.Let's light this place up.B.Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.John Ruth.Can I play that guitar over there?Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.But fourty seconds before that, something equally as important happened, but not everybody saw it.somebody.He did everything I asked, no blanket.was Domergue.Domergue's Got a Secret.Yeah.Yeah.My pistol plays a tune.Yeah, yeah, yeah.That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh?It's kinda' pretty.- Yeah I got.Gimme that guitar!Turn around.- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.Oh my god!Don't test me, bitch.Goddamit- Get or don't get, Joe Gage.- I'll get.You too, Senor Bob.Move 'em down snowshoes.You open your mouth; you gonna' get a bullet.Not a warning, not a question; a bullet.- Let me hear you say, "I got it".- "I got it" - "I got it".Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.Take this gun out of my holster.Like I said, anybody does anything.Kill 'em.you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth 'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy.But one of 'em is.Gimme the key!You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!'Meant it, didn't I?Now, one of y'all.Or two of y'all is workin' with her.but only one of you poisoned the coffy.But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman, so you kill him.But O.wasn't hangin' nobody.But he sure enough led over there dead now, though, ain't he?Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy.Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall don't practice in poison need to think about that.And about the men standin' next ta' ya' would be responsible.Yeah that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.We'll get there.Let's slow it way down.He did.- Yeah, he did, didn't he?How long you say Minnie been gone?Si.And it always tasted the same, no matter the meat.He made stew too and like my mama's.And no matter the meat, it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.So if Minnie's on the north side visiting her mama for a week, how'd she make the stew this morning?This.When I sat in it earlier, I couldn't belive it.This may be Minnie's place, but this is damn sure, Sweet Dave's chair.he went to the north side.What's in the chair?Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.are you actually accusing me of murder?And if it's you, that means Minnie and her man ain't at her mama's.Or if it's you Britisch Man, the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere.Or we go by my theory, which is the ugliest guy did it.So I take it you've deduced the coffy was poisoned while you were murdering the old man?Well, mi negro amigo, during that whole incident.Playing Silent Night on the piano.I said you didn't make the stew.you're working with man who poisoned the coffy.And at some point, y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.That's as far as I got.Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?Or can you prove it, cabrone?And it's a little bit more then my theory.Four months.- Minnie mentioned that to you?You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?And it hung over that Bar every day till she took down, a little over two years ago.She started lettin' in dogs.So when you tell me, Minnie went to North side to visit her mama?but okay - maybe.Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like Minnie".And if you lyin, which you are, then you killed Minnie - and Sweet Dave.That still don't get us no closer.- Does it Chris?Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy, to free Daisy.Okay, time's up.Alright I did it, it was me I poisoned the coffy.You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.You killed O.he's worth ten of you!Say adios to your Huevos.I ain't got no gun, sheriff.- Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?- Full house today, friend.Well he's gonna' hafta keep on waitin' cause we ain't got no room.Cause he's been here two days and Minnie wants him outta here.- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.Here we are everybody, Minnie's Haberdashery.When you're reday, stop on inside, get warm by the fire, get some coffy in you.Hi Minnie!But I would think coffy would be the first thing you'd make.- Hats!Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.Now the fella' in the uniform I don't know but the one he's playing chess with is Sweet Dave.- Hey Judy.Well that's not good enough.Oswaldo Mobray, madame.Bob.It's a pleasant surprise to find such a warm sanctuary in the middle of such a cold hell.Get warm by the fire.Stove, fireplace, whatever.Oh, and Judy said something about the best coffy in the world?Well I don't know 'bout all that.It's hot and it's strong and it's good.You don't need to sell it, Minnie, you need make it.- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.I don't know some old man.I'm just tellin' you what she said.Got 'em, Ed.Would you roll me a cigarette?It's my favorite.You play?Just never could keep the moves in my head.Hell no.Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.- It's french.- Oui- - Oui - what is that mean?Oui - Yes.- What?- It is.- Why?- Is your ass fat?Are you the jelly bean salesman around here?Five.- Here.Okay.I brought in your bags in case anybody wants to change your clothes before Red Rock.Thanks.Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team?- Could you holding this for me?Rock steady.- I take exception to that!- Carefull, madame.Auckland, what the fuck is an Auckland?- Coffy's ready!- Best coffy on the mountain.Stagecoach drivers like it.Most find it a mite too strong.Well, what'd ya' think?He adds something, not much, but something.Well I must admit, he does make the set up more convincing.And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.Well old man, if you was a cat what just happened here would count as one of your nine lives.- Yes.You believe that?- Not so fast old man.Later today, dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.- No.That's why.I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose.- No.- No I don't.I mean we did just kill Minnie and Sweet Dave.I just met these people.That is a good answer, old man.And you don't do nothin'.Hello, thank you, good night, that's about it.Hello, thank you, good night and.- Maybe my name.Go to sleep.- Do you understand?When it's safe I kill him, free my sister and leave you be.Deal, thank you.Put away the horses.Stash weapons for further use.Here they come.Let's get ready.Now killin' that fella' 'fore he kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.So the name of the game here is patience.Remember old man, my sister don't make it off this mountain alive, neither do you.Good luck, mate.I can see you already got another one up in here.This ain't the normal line.I can do another one.They ain't here.Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?He's lookin' after the place while they gone.- I'm Bob.B.Get 'em outta this cold, before that blizzard hit's 'em.You need it done fast, you need to help.You heard him freeloaders, get to work.- Open up!- What?Last Chapter Black Man, White Hell How you
