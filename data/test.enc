Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm.Good cold evening gentlemen, I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.Who wants to know?I'm Dr.What kinda doctor?Now are you the Speck Brothers, and did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?So, I wish to parley with you.Oh, I'm sorry.Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.Is there one amongst you, who was formerly a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?Who said that?Django.Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?Big John Ellis and Raja sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.Not anymore.Hey!Like what?My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain- Speak English, goddammit!I don't care.Now off wit' you!Move it.Last chance, fancy pants.Goddamn son of a bitch!And you killed Ace!And I do believe I have one, two, three, four, five witnesses who can attest to that fact.No doubt.God fucking dammit!Yeah.So Mr.Speck, how much for young Django here?Could you hold this for a moment?Django, get up on that horse.Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!One hundred ten twenty and five for young Django here.Also Mr.Do you have one?I thought not.I come prepared.This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.One: once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town.Or Two: You could unshackle yourselves take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one.Now wait a minute fellas, let's talk about this.I'm not a bad guy, look I'm just doing my job!Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le Duck in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.No, please- What's everybody staring at?Good morning inn keeper!Ah, it's still a bit early.By then we'll be servin' breakfast.What the hell you think you doin', boy?Help!Inn keeper!Alas Now we must act as our own bartender.What kinda dentist are you?These days I practice a new profession.D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?Well The way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter deals in corpses.The state places a bounty on a man's head, I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man, after I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities, and sometimes that's easier said then done, I show that corpse to the authorities proving, yes indeed, I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.What's a bounty?You kill people and they give you a reward?Bad people?Badder they are, bigger the reward!And I must admit that I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.On the other hand I need your help, if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.Still having said that I feel guilty.I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.But you do don't you?Good.You travel with me until we find them- Where we goin'?That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.You do that, I agree to give you your freedom, twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother -that's seventy-five dollars, and as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.Come on out.You bout your business.Now why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble, and scare all these nice people?What did you jus' do to our sheriff?Marshall, marshall!Can't we just leave?Move that buckboard long ways 'cross the street from the saloon!I want two men, two rifles up on this roof, two men two rifles on that roof.Somebody git poor Bill outta the goddamn street.We got a hundred riffles aimed on every way outta that buildin'!You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean, right now!Yes it is.S.That wunderbar, marshall.I trust, as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America, I shan't be shot down in the street, by either you or your deputies, before I've had my day in court.Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!Do I have your word as a lawman, not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?Fair enough marshall, here we come!So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.You unarmed?Marshall Tatum, may I address you and your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?My name is Dr.The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of two hundred dollars.The hell you say!But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years.C.Now this is a warrant, made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.He'll back up who I am, and who your dear departed sheriff was.I'll be damned.With a horse, seventy five dollars in your back pocket.Find my wife and buy her freedom.Do most slaves believe in marriage?All men in Carrucan did, and that's why we uh we run off.Boy's got sand.I want you to burn the runaway r right here on his cheek.And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction, and sell 'em Both of 'em Separately.In Greenville?You know when she was sold you know where she came from and you know her name.Broomhilda.Broom-hilda.Hm-hm.Yeah, how you know?Von Shafts.Your wife?When she was little, her mistress taught her so she has somebody speak German with.Your slave wife speaks German, and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?They call me Hildi.You'll be playing a character.No?D'you understand?Don't break character.What that is?Valet.And now Django, you may chose your character's costume.You- but of course!This is my valet, my valet does not walk.Not on my property.My good sir perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.My name is Dr.Mr.And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to parley with you now.You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?Oh, I'm afraid so.Now what'cha gotta say about that?Bennett, if you are the business man I've been led to believe you to be, I have five thousand things, I might say, that could change your mind.Huh?Oh maybe, while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.Eh, Betina!Eh What's your Jimmie name again?Django.As you please, Big Daddy.Bennett, I must remind you Django is a free man.Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.Betina, sugar?Django isn't a slave.You understand?Ya got it?No.Then I don't know what'cha want, Big Daddy.Uh What's the name of that peckawood boy from town that works with the glass?Oh, you mean Jerry.You know Jerry, don't you sugar?Well that's it then You just treat 'em like you would Jerry.Big daddy call it that, cause it's big.That's where Bid Daddy hang out his day meat.What'cha do for your massa'?So you really free?I as free.Betina, I need to ask you something.I'm lookin' for three white men.Their name is Brittle.Brittle?John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle.I don't know dem.They would have come to the plantation this past year.Maybe.Ah-huh.Ah-huh.Well one's over in that field.Like- like the bible say Look, I- I told you, I was the one to make her do it.She the one who went up for me and, thing about you we gettin' whipped now, that should be me!You know me a long time, now!She's- she's a house slave!If this what you want, to keep me funny fighting for each other, please I like the way you beg, boy.Yep.They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.Point me in that direction.Go git that white man I came here with.Com'on, Jody!And the Lord said the fear of ye and the dread of ye shall be on every beast of here.You better gimme that arm, you gotta gimme that arm!And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.Remember me?Goddamn son-of-a-bitch!Ooh no!That's Big John, and that's little Raj.He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now.Yeah.I dunno.I don't know what positive means.Yes.Yes I'm sure it is Ellis Brittle.Django!Who are you two jokers?King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America, the man to my left is Django Freeman, he's my deputy.They've gone by the name Shaffer.These are wanted men.Now I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive, so when Mr.I realize passions are high, but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against a office of the court in the performance of his duty is, you will be hung by the neck until you're dead.Gimmie.May I have that back, please?Post haste.Hell That's 'em sonsabitches.That's way too simple for these jokers.And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.We ready, or what?Oh shit.Who made this goddamn shit?Wll mk yu wn gddmn mk!Well if all I hadda do was cut a hole in a bag, I coulda cut it better than this.Not too good.But when I start ridin', the bag's moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.I just made mine worse.No, nobody brought an extra bag!Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose.I can't breathe in this fucking thing, and I can't ride in this fucking thing!Ya know I watched my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags to get ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches, and all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.Now look Let's not forget why we're here.And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.Are the bags on or off.Yeah.But not pointing 'ny fingers, they could have been done better.I get my bag off.I didn't say no bags.So?Goddamit!I can't see, you can't see.All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see!Where's this shit!Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.That nigger ain't down here!What?Well where are they?Bull time.Cowards tend to do that.Would you care to?I got 'em.I got 'em.For kids, ain't that short.Broomhilda is a German name.Lots of gals where you from named Broomhilda?There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?Do you know it?Would you like me to tell you?She was the daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.What she do?I think she disobeys him in some way.Broomhilda's on a mountain?And he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.And there, Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.Yes Django.A fella named Sigfried.Quite spectacularly so.He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.I know how he feel.Now Look Django I don't doubt that one day you will save your lady love.Slave Washington, in Mississippi, isn't a place for you to visit.But let me ask you a question.Kill white folks, and they pay you for it?And I have to admit, we make a good team.Yeah, on that occasion, you were a tad overzealous, but normally, that's a good thing.What'd ya mean partner up?I give you a third of my bounties.Why you care what happen to me?Frankly I've never given anybody their freedom before.Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.Ooh, what happened to mister I wanna shoot white folks for money?Well good.Maybe even share a last word.Put down the rifle.Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.Consider that today's lesson.Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall gang.Seven zero zero ze- Seven thousand.Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall, one thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang memb members.follows.That is who Smitty Bacall is.But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it.This is what I do.This corpse is worth seven thousand dollars.Pa?Here You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.It's good luck.That's accurate.Who the hell have you got there?Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?Huh.Let's comin' outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.Pretty good.Do it, walk!Don't let that mud slow you down, keep going.Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven, r on right cheek Calvin Candy.Candyland?Ain't no slave that ain't heard of Candyland.Let's just hope she works in the out, slaying in the field.She she pretty.The one you tore back up on the nag he burnt her runaway on her cheek.She no field nigger, but she ain't good enough for the house no more either.What's a comfort- Oh.So do we offer to buy her?He walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door, and asks the farmer to buy his horse.Well I say: fuck that farmer.Fair enough, but now you are horse thief, and they hang horse thieves.We need her and we need a bill of sale.May I offer an alternative plan for action?The man walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door, and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm, and makes an offer so ridiculous, the farmer's forced to say yes.No, it's far too big, but apparently, this farmer ain't all about the farm.What?Why?They call that One-Eyed Charly.Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire, we are here to see Mr.Enter.You want me to play a black slaver?A black slaver is lower than a head house nigger.Then play him that way, give me your black slaver.Schultz!Mr.Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment.So, this is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard so much about.Django, this is Mr.Just call me Leo.How long have you been associated with Mr.Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven when we went to boarding school together.One could almost say, I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.What did you say?Now, anything else about Mr.Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.He doesn't speak French.Get back on top now, turn around.There you go.You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?Answer the question.Pff, I'm bored.Well, come on over.Won't you accompany me to the bar?Dr..and I might add, an honor.Get Freeman Django here whatever he wants.You go way, boy, you do what I tell you!Com'on now!For God sake.De casse piu rapido.Hit that animal or you're ain't!La spola tappeto gi.Turn him around, now!Com'on now, use your strength!There you go!Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.Here you go!No!Do what I told you.Ground him back!No!Finish him.That's why they call him big Fred!Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!Proceed in.What's your name?Can you spell it?The D is silent.Umberto, andiamo.Moguy, I want you to take care o' my new boy here.You be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?Candy.You enjoy that, boy.Yessir.His name is Django Freeman.Where did ya dig him up?I've heard tell about you.What makes you such a mandingo expert?What did you say, boy?No offense given None taken.One.Yes!Wunderbar.Doc I'm a seasoned slaver, you are- well, you are a neophyte, I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy here is taking advantage of you.I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price.But we weren't talking business yet.Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.I know you didn't name me.Jambo.He does the eyeballin', you the billfold, is that it?So Bright Boy, Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh, and you was none too impressed, huh?Well then we got nothing more to talk about.He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.Well, hm.You won't even sell your second best.And what do you consider ridiculous?How much would you say, Django?Gentlemen You had my curiosity.Willie Willie.Hold up.Good morning, gentlemen.Schultz.You couldn't have picked a better one.Oh, thank you very much.Django!Say one nigger that just pops up on ten thousand.Bright day uh, Bright Boy?Shinin' on all of us.Great an honor.Thank you..The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.Everybody calm down!Are you- are you kiddin' me, this nigger- I said no harm done!Butch!Ev'rybody stop antagonizing my guests.Git back upon your horse.For God sake, somebody please help Who here back upon his goddamn horse.You got to listen to your boss, white boy.You wanna hold my hand?Take us home.No sir.No sir.Flash that bad look at me again, I give you a reason not to like me.You niggers gonna understand somethin' 'bout me.You keep them eyelash inside your ass, you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.Indeed!Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimen of Candyland, so before that moment, it would be good if I could have a confidential strategy meeting with my confident.I've confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back, and speaks German.Point being don't get so carried away with your retribution.You think I lost sight, did I?Stop antagonizing Candy!S.I'm not antagonizing.You- you're yelling abuse of these poor slaves!who had me killed another man in front o' his son, and he didn't bat an eye.Yeah of course I remember!So that's what I'm doing.Well you're paraphrasing a tad, but that was it generally, just see you at Candyland.Back at it.I'll 'be.Now well, why do a fool thing like run off?Yes you can!Mr.Hush now, Marsha!Marsha, hush up!Well now boy Gidown o' that tree.How long was he lose?How far he git off property?Pretty fer, conside'ing that limp he got.Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?The way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.Candy, I ain't got it, ain't it no more, I can't- No no no no, now no beggin' No playin' on my soft heart.I done paid 500 dollars for you When I pay 500 dollars I expect to get five fights outta a nigga 'fore he rollover and play dead.You- you fought three fights.Yes you did.Still the fact remain.So what 'bout my five hundred dollars, huh?You go n' reimburse me?You even know what reimburse means?You will?No, he won't.Matter o' facts, so am I.You heard 'em!Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he he ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.Stonesipher?That matter Won't have that.He's your nigger.Stonesipher?Marsha!Your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like 'nigger fightin'?He just ain't use to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs, is all.I'm just a little more use to American's than he is.We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.Cause as of now, if he's an example I ain't impressed.Line up to the left here now niggers.You gimme a line, gimme a line.Right now!Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.Oh Steven, you have nags for breakfast.Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you like a home miss flower, like a - like a- a baby miss Mum n' Teddy, I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.Hey Snowball.Just who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy?Let's keep it funny.This nigger here?Let me at least introduce the two of you.Steven, this is Django.Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain?Schultz are customers, and they are our guests, Steven, and you, you old decrepit bastard, are to show them every hospitality.Yessir, here I'm understandin', but I don't know why I gotta take lip off this nigger?Do you understand?Oh good!He gonna stay in the Big House?It's different.Well you gotta problem with that?Now that is my problem, they are mine to burn!And I want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them goddamn rooms ready!Go on now.You get a rollin' over and it's God man free right now.A nigger in the estate part.?Where is my beautiful sister!Dr.Darling, you are a diamond for tired eyes.Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie, you'll git your ass up on that hill.Go, com'on now.Like you on a rope!Niggers run!Hmm?Nigger girl?Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?You little Dickens, you!Steven, when you get through showing them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up and smellin' nice, and sent over to Dr.Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's- it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.What 'cha think she doin' there, in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.She ran off again.Two.Last night, they- they brought her back this morning.Lucky for her, they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.How long she been in the box?And the lit'le bitch got ten more days be in there.Take her out, why?Because I said so, that's why.Schultz is my guest.But Monsieur Candie, she just ran off.Now I realize it is inconvenient but still, you take her ass out!Lara Lee, will you and Cora be responsible for getting Hilda cleaned up and presentable for Dr.Of course, darling.Ya'all have heard the man, get yar ass, all part of it.Come here!Schultz.Git her back over here, alright girl?Hilda, you comin with me, or you gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?Dr.Hildi, this is Dr.It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.Well, it's not often a nigger speaks German, don't you know?The doctor here speaks German!Go ahead girl, speak a little German.And I should bring- Much obliged.Pardon.You silver tongued devil you.But the best three, by far, were: Sampson Well, what's his name again?Goldie and Eskimo Joe.Oh, you never know how these nigger nicknames get started.Well, regardless, Samson's your best, we all know that, you will never sell him, and I can see why, he's a champion.All three are champions.Them other two pretty good.You have to understand Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.Hence I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.He needs to have panache.Panache, hum A sense of showmanship!I want to be able to bill him him as the Black Hercules.More like niggerly.Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger per se but is he right as rain?Schultz, I will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J.Nobody.And that is a nigger that can win fights.Now after you have that, and you know you have that, then you can start to implement a grand design.First thing is first.Famously.Well hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.Ah, two weeks in Boston!And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.I don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.Dr.You gotta finish this, you got to put your elbow in this, this is, do you hear me- You know that nigger, don't ya?Who??I don't know him.No.No sir.Okay If- if you say so.But if it was my money I wouldn't pay no twelve thousand dollars for him.Well, if I was inclined to be generous, and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous nine thousand maybe.Schultz Let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.It was you who approached me to buy one.Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was banding about, that ain't too far off from right, and if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I could do so any day of the week.But like you said in Greenville doctor, I don't wanna sell 'em.Hmm-hmm.Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!However, that is a tremendous amount of money.Moguy, I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named Tuttle, And I would need my Mr.Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.So say I return in about .five days time.!Tuttle.Tuttle and your Mr.I say splendid Doctor Splendid.Or, shall we call him the Black Hercules.The Black Hercules!Hildi I'm outta drink, girl.When Monsieur Candy talk to you, you answers.Hmm-hmm.Maybe it's not quite as much fun as getting the pleasure o' the mandingos, huh sugar babe?Like Simpson, huh?You know Monsieur Candie, Hmm?Dr.No, we just talked and Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?Hildi, com'on take off your dress, show Dr.Uh, Calvin, I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,they don't got niggers there.I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers endurance for pain.Schultz, no doubt about it.Lare Lee, just get- why don't you lose her goddamn mat?Calvin!Fine.After dinner.Uh?She all messed.Oh!I just got you done, now come over, here!You said you ain't know him?I said you said you ain't know him.Yes you do.Why is you lyin' to me?Then why is you cry?Why is I'm scarin' you?.to speak German this afternoon with Hildi, was positively soul enriching.You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.Yesiree Bob I did.I'm all ears.Monsieur Candie- Steven!Schultz here!Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen.If you could manage it.It's about dessert.I'd rather discuss that in private.What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?Meet me in the library.Fine, fine friend Steven, I will be along momentarily.Well gentlemen as you can see, talented as they are no doubt in the kitchen, from time to time adult supervision is required.You may clear the dinner service.So Dr.The circus!Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos.Steven, what the hell are you talkin' about, hm?They ain't here for no muscle bound jimmie, they here for that girl.What Hildi?Her and Django?He he just bought Eskimo Joe.No, not yet, but they go- Then he didn't buy diddly, not yet no how.Thank you Steven.Whe- where you gettin' all this?They're doin' it cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.Now, why that German give a fuck who that uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.You wouldn't pay no never mind into three hundred dollar.That made you real friendly now, didn'it?His wife, uh?Those lyin' goddamn time wastin' sonsabitches..out of New Orleans, so I had quite a bit of practice with theaters types.I was beginning to think that you and that old crow ran off together.Lara Lee I was just lookin' out the big window.Of course, brother.Okay.A propos before your exit, we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.Yes we would.Who is your little friend?And I do mean a long damn time.Growin'up the son of a of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi puts a white men in contact with a whole lot o' black faces.And seein' them ev'ry day, day in day out, I I only had one question.Now right up there on that porch three times a week for fifty years, Ol'Ben here would shave my Daddy with a straight razor.But he never did.You see the science of analogy is crucial to understandin' the separation about two species.If you examine this peace of skull here you'll notice three distinct dimples.Now If I was holding a skull of a- of a of an Isaac Newton or Galileo, these three dimples would be found in the area o'the skull most associated with creativity.And in the skull of Ol'Ben, unburden by genes, these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with servility.But if I took this hammer here and I bashed it in your skull you would have the same three dimples.Now lay your palms flat on the table top!Butch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off!Mr.Thank you ever so much.Where were we?Oh yes I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.Right then.Your way, honey.Lay your hands flat on that table.Dr.To which, me myself said, What is your definition of ridiculous?Now considering you all have ridden a whole lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble, and done spread a whole lotta bull, to purchase this lovely lady right here, it would appear that Broomhilda is in fact the Right Nigger!And I take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating?You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda here is my property.And if you all think my price for this nigger here is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do is take this fuckin' hammer here, and beat her ass to death with it!Ain't it good, fella?Now!Huh?May I lift the hands off the table top in order to remove my billfold?That twelve.To the man with the exceptional beard, and his unexceptional nigger.Moguy.You make this gentleman a receipt for twelve thousand dollar, please.Hm.Now gentlemen If you care to join me in the parlor we will be serving white cake.Excuse me Excuse me, madam?Take your hands off that harp!Doc, you can't go in there!He got no business goin' in there.He's a little upset, that's all.White cake?You brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya, uh?D'Artagnan.Come again?He wrote The Three Musketeers.I figured you must be an admirer, you named your slave after his novel's lead character.You doubt he'd approve?Soft hearted Frenchy?Are these Broomhilda's papers?May I?Thank you.Would you have ink and pen for me?Thank you.Broomhilda Von Shaft consider yourself a free woman.But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is till I see you again, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say good bye.Com'on.What?It implies good faith.But you are in my house doctor.Insist?That I shake your hand?You know what I think you are?No I don't.And I think you're an abysmal winner.Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.I don't think so.Butch, if she tries to leave here before this nigger lovin' German shakes my hand, you cut her ass down.I insist.Aaah Calvin!I'm sorry.The nigger's going crazy, the hell- Help, he's blowing everybody- Aaah!Son of a bitch!What the- Don't strike
